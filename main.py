Of these, only the harlequin ladybird is firmly established the UK, where it is now the most common ladybird species. Insect curator at London's Natural History Museum, Max Barclay, predicts that the brown stink bug could establish in parts of the South East of England and may spread further with climate change. \"The brown marmorated stink bug is very similar to many harmless native species, so we hope people won't go out and start squashing everything similar!\" he said. \"We are only trying to determine how widespread it is at this stage, and we are happy to identify specimens sent to the museum's Facebook group or via email. \" The three sightings so far have been in Essex, Surrey, and in the Museum's Wildlife Garden. media captionThe slug invasion that could devastate your garden The warning came as the RHS released its latest tally of pests plaguing gardens, with slugs and snails topping the list. The box tree caterpillar slipped down the rankings as its march slows across England and Wales. Honey fungus topped the list of diseases, as it has for 25 years. With more people spending time in their garden during lockdown, the RHS reported an 88% increase in pest and disease enquiries last year.

Now, the county is set to increase the number of oil and gas wells from 78,000 to 121,000, after a controversial ordinance was unanimously approved earlier this week by the Kern County Board of Supervisors to fast-track the permitting of 43,000 new wells over the next 15 years. Oil and gas drilling in the county already weighs heavily on the residents of Kern. Some 71,000 people in Kern County \u2014 nearly 8 percent of residents \u2014 live within roughly a half-mile of oil and gas wells, and a third of the county\u2019s wells are within the same distance of schools and hospitals. As a result, drilling has taken a toll on public health from the particulate matter in the air as well as from the toxic soup of chemicals in the wells. Living near these sites is linked to a host of health conditions: respiratory problems, migraines, nosebleeds, higher rates of asthma attacks, cancer, and preterm birth. More than 250 residents spoke out against the ordinance at a Board of Supervisors meeting before the vote on Monday, with many citing the effects of oil and gas drilling on their health. These burdens are not evenly distributed: Of the 1.8 million Californians who live within a mile of oil and gas development and live in heavily polluted areas, 92 percent are people of color. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the rich, white suburbs that are affected, it\u2019s Black, Latinx, and low-income communities that will be,\u201d said Riddhi Patel, the communications coordinator for the Center for Race, Poverty, and Environment, or CRPE, at the hearing. \u201cIf you choose to approve this ordinance, there is blood on your hands.\u201d Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy The ordinance is an updated version of one that was passed in 2015, which allowed oil and gas companies to bypass a lengthy review for each proposed well by issuing a blanket environmental statement. Last year, a California appellate court deemed that ordinance illegal for violating the California Environmental Quality Act. Before it was struck down, however, the county had approved more than 18,000 permits under the old ordinance, most of them in census tracts that were predominantly low-income and Hispanic \u2014 creating sacrifice zones in the service of oil extraction. Juan Flores, a Kern County organizer for CRPE, said he\u2019s not surprised that the Board of Supervisors approved the ordinance despite the pushback at Monday\u2019s hearing. In Flores\u2019 view, the Board of Supervisors is highly sympathetic to the oil industry. Now that the ordinance has passed, he says it\u2019s time for California Governor Gavin Newsom and state agencies such as the California Geologic Energy Management Division, the agency in charge of regulating the oil and gas industry, to take action. He noted that Newsom has failed to follow through on campaign promises to ban fracking and get tough on the oil industry. \u201cSo far with this administration, we\u2019ve seen a lot of rhetoric, a lot of words, a lot of promises,\u201d said Flores. \u201cYet we have not gotten to the actions.\u201d One way to mitigate the public health impacts of drilling in Kern County, and statewide, would be to introduce setback regulations, a mandatory minimum distance between oil and gas wells and residential areas \u2014 a regulation that many oil-producingstatesalreadyhave in place. Activists in California have been advocating for setbacks for years, but haven\u2019t yet succeeded at the state level. A bill that would have introduced 2,500-foot setbacks in the state was voted down last August by the California Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Water, with three Democratic senators voting against the bill. A new bill that would ban fracking and institute setbacks for new and renewed oil and gas permits, SB 467, was introduced last month in the California state Senate. One obstacle to passing legislation like SB 467 is the sheer amount of money invested by the oil industry into California politics. The oil industry spent more than $10 million lobbying California politicians last year against policies they opposed, including setback regulations. Flores pointed to SB 467 as an opportunity for legislators to prove that they\u2019re serious about fighting environmental injustice and climate change. But in the meantime, regarding California\u2019s image as a green state, Flores said, \u201cThe reality is that we\u2019re way too far from it. Our communities are still dying.\u201d", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Flores": [-5.110469999999964, -42.86522999999994], "Of": [40.94371000000007, 40.26192000000003]}}, {"headline": "Perseverance rover begins its exploration of Mars", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-56297996", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13517/production/_117472197_r1-perseverance_is_roving_on_mars_wcufqaq.original.png", "text": "image captionPerseverance has gone to Mars with tougher wheels than its predecessors Everyone, however, has been waiting for Perseverance to start rolling. It happened on Thursday. The robot went forward a short way, spun on the spot 150 degrees, and then backed up a bit. \"You can see the wheel tracks that we left on Mars; I don't think I've ever been happier to see wheel tracks,\" said Perseverance mobility engineer Anais Zarifian. \"This is just a huge milestone for the mission and the mobility team. We've driven on Earth but driving on Mars - that's the ultimate goal, and just so many people have worked towards this very moment for years.\" image copyrightChing-Ming Cheung image captionThe robot's landing site has been named in honour of scifi author Octavia E. Butler Perseverance was put down in a near-equatorial crater called Jezero, to search for evidence of past life. This will involve roving some 15km over the coming Martian year (roughly two Earth years). Scientists want to reach a number of enticing rock formations in the crater that might retain a record of ancient biological activity. Among these is what looks in satellite imagery to be a delta - a structure built up from the silt and sand dumped by a river as it enters a wider body of water. In Jezero's case, this wider body was very likely a crater-wide lake that existed billions of years ago. image copyrightNASA/JPL-CALTECH image captionAn early target for study could be the layered rocks in this mound The mission team is considering two possible routes to the delta, one of which would give scientists a preview by taking the robot past an isolated remnant. \"This (mound) is about a mile-and-a-half away from the rover. You can actually resolve layering within the rocks,\" said Dr Stack Morgan. \"In this outcrop, these resistant layered rocks were likely deposited by rivers flowing into the ancient Lake Jezero, and scientists on the team are hard at work trying to understand the significance and origin of rocks like this.\" An immediate goal for Perseverance is its helicopter experiment. The rover brought a small chopper with it from Earth. The vehicle will spend the next few weeks driving from its present location to a suitable stretch of terrain where the 2kg device called Ingenuity can be put safely on the ground. At present, the aircraft is slung beneath Perseverance's belly. \"We're still figuring out the possible flight zones,\" said Robert Hogg, Perseverance's deputy mission manager. \"We're taking navigation camera images, stereo images, to be able to analyse the terrain. And also the team's been looking at orbital images looking at possible flight zones. Long story short, we're still aiming for getting that done in the spring,\" he told reporters. media captionFour images in a sequence that show the end part of the drive Perseverance is the fastest rover Nasa has ever put on Mars. This is not so much because of the rate at which the wheels can turn (about 5cm/s), but rather because of advances in autonomous navigation. The robot takes pictures to assess the road ahead. Previous vehicles had to stop while these images were processed onboard. Perseverance can do this on the fly. \"Perseverance can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" said Anais Zarifian. Nasa announced on Friday that it had named Perseverance's landing site in Jezero Crater after the celebrated American science fiction writer Octavia E. Butler. The same honour was given to scifi author Ray Bradbury in 2012. His name will forever be associated with the touchdown location of the US space agency's previous rover, Curiosity.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {}}, {"headline": "A 1930s city planning rule has drivers setting their own speed limits", "url": "https://grist.org/energy/a-1930s-city-planning-rule-has-drivers-setting-their-own-speed-limits/", "image_url": "https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnail-speedlimits_wp.jpg", "text": "Speed limits are set by drivers \u201cvoting with their feet.\u201d That\u2019s a problem for everyone else on the street.\n\nSources:\n\nNACTO | City Limits\n\nLos Angeles City Council | 2008 Speed Limit Report\n\nLos Angeles Department of Transportation | 2018 Speed Limit Report\n\nBrian Taylor and Yu Hong Hwang | Eighty-Five Percent Solution: Historical Look at Crowdsourcing Speed Limits and the Question of Safety\n\nITE | Speed Zoning Information A Case of \u201cMajority Rule\u201d\n\nHammond, et al. | Traffic Engineering and the Police\n\nUS Bureau of Public Roads | Accidents on Main Rural Highways, 1964\n\nGet Grist in your inbox\n\nAlways free, always fresh The First 100 Other choices Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you.

This change affected around 234,000 private households and 9,000 businesses. Before the switch, the numbers choosing to have green power were at around 3%. Afterwards, this rose to 80-90% of customers. Residential consumers had to pay at least 3-8% more for their energy on the green tariff, while businesses saw their costs increase by up to 14% for energy used at night. image copyrightGetty Images image captionHydropower is a major component of the Swiss energy mix Remarkably, these extra costs weren't enough to push consumers to change their tariffs back to ones with fossil fuels in the mix. \"It is worth noting that even five years after the change, some 80% of the households are still sticking with green electricity,\" said co-author Dr Jennifer Gewinner, from ETH Zurich, a public research university in Switzerland's largest city. It was a similar story for small business customers. Several years after the switch, more than 70% were still on the more expensive green tariff. In the case of large companies, which had considerable choice in terms of which energy provider to go with, the vast majority stayed with green energy even though it was costing them around $2,300 extra per year. The researchers believe that what they are observing is the surprising power of the default effect. This is a widely known phenomenon in different spheres, such as in organ donation, where laws have changed in many countries so that the people have to opt out if they don't want to donate after death. image copyrightGetty Images image captionEurope's oldest operating nuclear power plant at Beznau has long been controversial in Switzerland A more mundane example is with double-sided printing, which has become the default in many offices to reduce wastage. However, the authors of the Swiss study were surprised that this effect held up so well with energy, considering the greater costs involved. The researchers believe that some of the reluctance to change is down to the human condition. \"You have to switch to the other cheaper tariff bills actively,\" said team leader Prof Andreas Diekmann, from ETH Zurich. \"You can do it by email or by a phone call, but many people just don't do it.\" As well as people's inherent reluctance to tackle the paperwork involved in changing back to fossil fuels, there were other factors at play. \"People are a bit overwhelmed because it is a hard topic to actually feel competent to choose your own tariff,\" said Dr Gewinner. \"So if you help them and tell them we are all moving now to renewable energy, they feel okay. It was kind of what they wanted to do anyway. \"I think that's what makes default settings stick so much, because we understand that it's the recommended product, like the safe choice.\" One of the concerns that suppliers have about green energy tariffs is that customers will increase their overall use of electricity because they feel that it's clean and sustainable. Over the six-year period of the study, the researchers found no evidence of greater consumption among those using renewable power. The authors also believe that moving to a green default setting would have a major impact on carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in countries with a high reliance on fossil fuels such as the US, China or Germany. \"We made a simulation for Germany with data from 2018,\" explained Prof Diekmann. \"We figured out that when all companies would do it only for their private customers, the saving was 45 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. That's a big impact, equal to about 5% of all the CO2 emissions in Germany.\" But would this idea work if every energy supplier offered a green default - is there enough green energy to go around? \"The companies we work with, they were also afraid that they would need more renewable energy than they were able to support,\" said Dr Gewinner. \"But I think what our study does is help is to give you an estimate, of how many customers in your household sector and in your business sector will be likely to stick with green energy, and that will help the companies to actually calculate.\" Dr Gewinner believes the idea should be applicable all over the world.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {}}, {"headline": "Too British for America?

Extinction Rebellion is getting lost in translation. In the fall of 2018, thousands of activists in London drew the world\u2019s attention by blockading bridges, supergluing their hands to government buildings, and getting arrested by the dozens. Waving colorful flags with the \u201cextinction symbol,\u201d an hourglass inside a circle, demonstrators from Extinction Rebellion warned that time was running out to tackle the planet\u2019s ecological crisis. They started staging \u201cdie-ins\u201d and pouring fake blood made from beets all over the streets. The point was to get attention, and it worked. In the summer before these protests, there were only 10 people in Extinction Rebellion, also known as XR; by December, the movement had spread to 35 countries. The Guardian declared it \u201cthe fastest-growing environmental organization in the world.\u201d The rebellion soon came to the United States \u2014 to a degree. \u201cUntil I saw what XR was doing in the U.K. in 2018, I didn\u2019t realize that it was something I ever wanted to do,\u201d said Christina See, now an organizer for the New York City chapter of Extinction Rebellion. The decentralized organization has about 70 local groups around the United States, and the offshoot organization XR Youth US has a couple dozen more. But in New York City, home to 8 million people, only a few hundred are active with XR, according to See. By contrast, protests in London, a city of nearly 9 million, brought out thousands in 2019. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy Extinction Rebellion isn\u2019t making headlines as often as it did in the past, partly because the COVID-19 pandemic has kept many at home, and also because racial-justice protests in response to the killing of George Floyd have taken center stage in the U.S. and Europe. But organizers say that the movement isn\u2019t going anywhere. Extinction Rebellion now has more than 1,000 local groups spread around the globe, from Argentina to Zambia. Just this week, XR protesters in Adelaide, Australia, blocked rush-hour traffic by gluing themselves to the pavement and releasing smoke flares. \u201cI don\u2019t see XR fading away at any point,\u201d See said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just going to grow.\u201d One possible reason XR has yet to blow up in the United States like it did in the United Kingdom: cultural and political differences. \u201cThe blueprint was created with England in mind,\u201d said Daze Aghaji, a 20-year-old climate activist in the U.K. who was an early member of XR Youth, an offshoot of the movement. (Aghaji is currently taking a break from Extinction Rebellion for self-reflection, but expects to return.) Aghaji said she\u2019s worked with XR groups all over the world, and \u201csome of them expect it as a \u2018one glove fits all\u2019\u201d kind of situation. Instead, Aghaji said, groups need to adapt to local circumstances. For example, she said, laws around arrest are different in the United Kingdom from other places in the world. \u201cIf you do road-blocking in the U.K., you get warnings before they arrest you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if a new person comes in, they can feel comfortable to sit on the road. And then if they feel uncomfortable and don\u2019t want to get arrested, they can get up when they get their warning.\u201d It\u2019s not just tactics that need to be adapted \u2014 capturing the playful spirit of the movement also requires translation. In the U.K., protesters have danced in the streets, shown up in elaborate carnival costumes, and occasionally worn nothing (save for signs protesting fast fashion). \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that a lot of Americans see on XR logos and XR banners that you don\u2019t quite get,\u201d Aghaji said. \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s very British.\u201d She pointed to how Extinction Rebellion UK has used the phrase \u201cEton mess,\u201d the name of a traditional British dessert, to make fun of government officials that went to Eton, an elite boarding school famous for churning out prime ministers, like David Cameron, Boris Johnson, and some 18 others.\u201cYou have to use your own cultural expressions to get that funniness and quirkiness that the spirit of XR is,\u201d she said. TOLGA AKMEN / AFP via Getty Images Extinction Rebellion simply isn\u2019t very recognizable to the average American yet, said Dana Fisher, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland. \u201cI hate to use the term \u2018brand\u2019 to talk about an organization,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they have a very clear brand loyalty and brand identity in Europe and in the U.K.\u201d XR\u2019s U.S. wing declined interview requests for this story, saying that the national organization is undergoing changes. \u201cThe present interim team is serving in a caretaker capacity and does not feel empowered to speak in the name of our chapters,\u201d XR US said in a statement to Grist. To be sure, a lot was going on with American activism during the middle of the Trump era, when Extinction Rebellion arose. In the United States, progressive activists were busy protesting the Muslim ban, the Mexico border wall, federal attacks on science, and so much else. Among those protesting for climate action, the United States had an \u201cextremely dense organizational landscape\u201d of climate groups already, Fisher said; the youth-focused Sunrise Movement ended up catching on instead. Extinction Rebellion activists tend to lean older, she said, though they include organizers of all ages. That said, Fisher thinks Extinction Rebellion still has a shot at taking off in the U.S. \u201cA lot of groups are going to start to try to focus on how they can support the Biden administration as they work on specific issues,\u201d Fisher said. That could create an opening for groups that want to push back at the administration\u2019s policies, saying they aren\u2019t going far enough \u2014 and the splashy protests that Extinction Rebellion became known for could provide a template. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity for nonviolent civil disobedience that people feel safe doing, they could then mobilize people,\u201d Fisher said. Extinction Rebellion organizers might have other things in mind. \u201cA lot of our work with Extinction Rebellion isn\u2019t just on the streets protesting,\u201d See said. It\u2019s also focusing on pushing the media and local governments to take the climate crisis more seriously. The movement has recently shifted to a new campaign on \u201cfinancial disobedience,\u201d taking aim at the investment giant BlackRock and banks financing fossil fuel infrastructure. This so-called Money Rebellion aims to use nonviolent direct action, \u201cdebt strikes,\u201d and social media to \u201cexpose and disrupt the economic rules and institutions driving us toward societal collapse: growth, debt, banks, the government.\u201d The lockdowns last year really changed things, Aghaji said. \u201cOur thing was about being physical, using your body as a tool,\u201d Aghaji said. \u201cWe had to very rapidly go, how do we hold government accountable without physically doing what we\u2019re so used to doing?\u201d Critics in the U.K. have argued that Extinction Rebellion hasn\u2019t been sensitive enough to matters of race, an issue that led to a schism among XR activists in the U.S. Aghaji said that XR has done a lot of internal work around anti-racism that\u2019s not reflected when outsiders see mostly white organizers blocking the road. \u201cI do think XR did make a lot of mistakes,\u201d Aghaji said. \u201cIn all honesty, I think that we should give a little bit of forgiveness, because we\u2019re a really young organization.\u201d Being in XR, she said, felt like trying to build an airplane while you\u2019re already flying it.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"New York": [40.71455000000003, -74.00713999999994], "Adelaide": [-34.92584999999997, 138.59980000000007], "London": [51.50642000000005, -0.1272099999999341], "Maryland": [38.81819928400006, -76.15872999999993], "University": [34.36515000000003, -89.53374999999994]}}, {"headline": "Japan earthquake: The day 'tomorrow didn't come'", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-56344142", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p09991xp.jpg", "text": "Japan's triple disaster 10 years on: The day \u2018tomorrow didn\u2019t come\u2019 Japan's triple disaster 10 years on: The day \u2018tomorrow didn\u2019t come\u2019 It\u2019s 10 years since Japan was hit by a giant 9.0-magnitude earthquake, triggering a massive tsunami.

See our privacy policy \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Kahele said of the diversity of opinions within the Native American caucus. \u201cWe\u2019re there to work together, and Native American issues and Native Alaskan issues and Native Hawaiian issues are very much the same.\u201d Indigenous representation in Congress first surged two years ago, after the 2018 midterm elections. Deb Haaland, who is an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Laguna and has Jemez Pueblo heritage, was elected to represent New Mexico\u2019s first congressional district. Sharice Davids, an enrolled member of the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, was elected to represent Kansas\u2019 third congressional district. Both Democrats were reelected this month. From rising sea levels and dying coastal ecosystems to drought and crop losses, the six House districts that will be represented by Native Americans next year face a variety of imminent threats from climate change. Here\u2019s how these representatives plan to tackle the unique climate challenges faced by their constituents. New Mexico Native Americans make up 30 percent of New Mexico\u2019s population, but they have accounted for about half of the state\u2019s confirmed COVID-19 cases. Representative Deb Haaland was alarmed by this disparity, but it did not surprise her. Native communities suffer disproportionately from bad indoor air quality, and asthma rates in Native American and tribal populations are almost twice the national average, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A deadly pandemic involving a respiratory disease was bound to take an outsize toll on these communities. \u201cIf you\u2019re breathing polluted air every single day and then a respiratory virus comes through, it stands to reason that it\u2019s going to affect the population there,\u201d Haaland told Grist. Haaland is vice chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, and she wants to push for more renewable energy in her district. During her second term, Haaland said she hopes to stop the leasing of public lands to fossil fuel companies. She\u2019s hopeful that the incoming presidential administration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will take environmental justice seriously by investing in clean infrastructure and targeting policies to help the most at-risk communities. Haaland praised the Biden-Harris climate plan for promoting greater access to medical care, housing improvements, and green infrastructure in tribal nations. \u201cThe Biden administration has the most progressive platform for our earth and the climate ever,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, The Hill reported that Biden\u2019s transition team was vetting Haaland for a possible cabinet appointment as Secretary of the Interior. Yvette Herrell, an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation who is the representative-elect for New Mexico\u2019s second congressional district, is seemingly Haaland\u2019s polar opposite. \u201cI will work with President Trump to reduce job killing regulations, cut taxes for our middle class, and rebuild our rural economies by opening the door to logging, mining, and expanded energy production,\u201d the Republican tweeted in May. Hawaii From rising seas to dying coral reefs to decreased rainfall, Hawaii is experiencing some of the starkest effects of climate change. Democratic Representative-elect Kai Kahele is sensitive to the ways in which a warming planet threatens Hawaiins in general, and Native Hawaiins in particular. Hawaii is already a leader in solar energy generation, and in 2015 it passed a law requiring that the state\u2019s grid run on 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. Already, 90 percent of Kauai\u2019s daytime energy needs are met by renewable sources. Kahele said that Hawaii should build on these gains. In particular, he wants to see more investment in innovative new renewable technologies such as ocean thermal energy conversion. Kahele supports the Green New Deal, but he\u2019s not pollyannaish about its chances in Congress, especially if Republicans retain control of the Senate. The Green New Deal \u201cis a big bold idea\u201d and \u201can aspirational dream,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as bold legislation goes, the American people have spoken and, should they decide that Republicans will maintain hold of the Senate, we need to come back to the drawing board and figure out what we can work with.\u201d Kansas Representative Sharice Davids, a Democrat, is the second-ever Native American to represent Kansas in Congress. (Charles Curtis, who served in Congress from 1893 to 1907, was the first.) She believes that federal and local governments should address climate issues by focusing on public health and investing in infrastructure, such as sustainable housing. Davids has not endorsed the Green New Deal, preferring instead to hold out for legislation that might be more likely to receive bipartisan support. A member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Davids has said that policies like updating building codes to promote better insulation, sustainable materials, and lower energy usage are a big part of building widespread resilience in the face of the climate crisis. \u201cI wanted to be on that committee because transportation and infrastructure has a huge impact on climate change,\u201d Davids said at a town hall event in March. Oklahoma Representatives Markwayne Mullin, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, and Tom Cole, an enrolled member of Chickasaw Nation, are two of five congressional representatives from Oklahoma. Both are Republicans who have supported President Trump\u2019s policies. While the two now agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity, they support an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d energy strategy, eliminating environmental regulations that restrict the oil and gas industry, and maintaining Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2016 Paris climate agreement. Oklahoma is home to 39 federally-recognized sovereign tribes, and Mullin\u2019s and Cole\u2019s constituents are already grappling numerous threats posed by climate change. Average temperatures in the Great Plains have already risen by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Rainfall levels have swung wildly in recent years, oscillating between drought and flooding. The variability in water availability has hit farmers and ranchers in the state particularly hard. The 2010-2011 drought resulted in $2 billion in losses as farmers, who primarily depend on rainwater for irrigation, saw massive crop losses. According to the EPA, in the coming decades crop yields in Oklahoma are likely to decrease by 50 percent in areas where irrigated water is not available. Despite its reputation as a major oil producer, Oklahoma has invested heavily in wind energy. The state ranked second in the country in wind energy production last year. (Texas ranked first.) Perhaps as a result, Mullin and Cole have touted the state\u2019s renewable energy record. But the two have slightly different positions on how the industry should be supported. Mullin has said that wind energy\u2019s success in Oklahoma shows that renewable energy can be supported by the free market alone, while Cole has supported additional investments in renewables through tax credits. (Neither Cole nor Mullin responded to Grist\u2019s request for interviews.) \u201cI actually do believe that climate change is real and that humans are having an impact on it,\u201d Cole said at a town hall event last year. \u201cI\u2019m all for more renewable energy resources.\u2026 I just think we need to look at different ways of addressing this problem, and we shouldn\u2019t sacrifice our economy to try to fix it.\u201d", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Kansas": [38.48472671300004, -98.38017062899996], "March": [52.55128000000008, 0.0885000000000673], "Oklahoma": [35.582683950000046, -97.50859936099994], "Split": [43.50275000000005, 16.44273000000004], "Texas": [31.46273304600004, -99.33305008999997], "Paris": [48.85717000000005, 2.3414000000000215], "Pueblo": [38.26375000000007, -104.61251999999996], "Deal": [51.223160000000064, 1.403060000000039], "Laguna": [-28.482959999999935, -48.783729999999935]}}, {"headline": "This technology collaborative promises a brighter future for solar", "url": "https://grist.org/article/this-technology-collaborative-promises-a-brighter-future-for-solar/", "image_url": "https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/solar-panels.jpg", "text": "This technology collaborative promises a brighter future for solar Being stuck at home has turned out to be a great way to help the U.S. honor its Paris Agreement commitment to cut greenhouse emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. A lot of people did their part in 2020, whether or not they framed their contribution in exactly those terms. With the COVID-19 pandemic confining many Americans to their homes, a significant number of people used the money they might otherwise have spent on travel or eating out to invest in rooftop solar systems. Last year\u2019s spike is an extension of solar\u2019s long-term upward trend. From 2010 to 2019, the U.S. increased its solar power by a factor of 30. During that time, solar prices dropped by about 80%. But in order for solar power to achieve broad use, prices must fall by another 50% by the end of this decade, according to Jared Silvia, CEO of a Seattle-based solar start-up called BlueDot Photonics. BlueDot, with support from Portland nonprofit VertueLab, aims to make this goal a reality by using new-to-the-industry materials to make panels as much as 50% more efficient. One major limitation of silicon is that it captures only a fraction of the sunlight that strikes it. Certain wavelengths reflect off its surface, pass through it, or are absorbed without being converted to energy. Knowing this, solar researchers have long sought to harness materials that would capture and convert a greater percentage of sunlight into electrical current. Enter a class of crystalline compounds called perovskites. Strictly speaking, perovskite is a mineral composed of calcium titanate, but the word is used to refer to any compound that shares the same crystal structure \u2014 a structure that excels at absorbing sunlight. These materials came onto the solar scene a little more than a decade ago, when researchers in the U.K. and Japan first noticed their light-converting potential. Perovskites seemed like they could be an attractive alternative to silicon because, unlike silicon, they could be made synthetically at relatively low cost, and because perovskite solutions could be painted, printed, or sprayed onto a wide variety of surfaces. At first, their efficiency was an unimpressive 3.8%, but in the past decade, researchers have boosted that to 25.5%, with potential maximum efficiency estimated to be about 33%. But if perovskites are to become solar power\u2019s next big thing, they\u2019ll have to overcome two obstacles. First is the problem of their relative instability. The molecular structure of perovskites tends to deteriorate in heat, making them ill-suited to bask in the sun all day. In the past few years, however, researchers have experimented successfully with stabilizing the material by slightly altering the chemical recipe. They are optimistic that it will soon be stable enough for broad commercial use. The second challenge for perovskites is how to bring a nascent technology to a scale commensurate with solar\u2019s expanding market. Researchers at BlueDot think they\u2019ve found a solution. Out of the lab, into the market In the future, solar cells powered exclusively by perovskite may become a reality. For now, though, most researchers are focusing on creating cells that combine perovskite with the already ubiquitous silicon. \u201cWhen we started BlueDot, we saw that it was going to be hard to compete against silicon,\u201d says Silvia, a University of Washington alumnus. \u201cSo we wanted to start by working with the silicon industry.\u201d Perovskites and silicon are a potent combination because they capture different wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Since solar cells work by translating light into current, more collected light has the potential to translate to a stronger current. A layer of perovskite (which absorbs high-energy light) atop a band of silicon (which absorbs light lower on the spectrum) could combine to make a turbo-powered solar cell. In practice, though, achieving this marriage of materials faces a number of technical challenges. Foremost among them is designing perovskite-silicon hybrids that equalize the amount of current generated by each layer. If the currents generated by the layers are different, the resulting current will only be as strong as the weaker of the two. Four years ago, a Chinese research team discovered that adding a bit of ytterbium, a rare earth element, to a perovskite film converted blue photons into infrared light that was subsequently absorbed into an underlying silicon layer. By producing a single current, this method solves the two-current problem. Another challenge remained, however. The perovskites created by the research team were nanoparticles that were difficult to apply in a uniform layer on top of a silicon cell. Two years ago, Daniel Gamelin, a chemistry professor at the University of Washington, found a solution: If perovskite powders were vaporized, they could be redeposited as thin, high-quality films on virtually any surface. Even better, the process could be accomplished at high speeds, and could be tailored for specific needs. For example, perovskites could be applied to the walls of buildings or to the curved surfaces of car roofs. Gamelin shared his research with colleagues, and a group of them banded together to form BlueDot with the goal of further developing the technique and making it available for commercial use. Last year, BlueDot helped launch a perovskite technology consortium with other leading solar startups as well as university research groups and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The U.S. Manufacturing of Advanced Perovskites Consortium will give participating researchers access to testing facilities and allow them to easily share their research. The ultimate goal is to accelerate the integration of perovskites into the solar industry. Silvia predicts that the first commercial products using BlueDot\u2019s technique will be installed in 2023. \u201cAnd once we get that first adopter, a landslide of new adopters will come,\u201d he says.

Scientists identified 926 \"spill events\" from two wastewater treatment plants over an 11-year period by employing machine learning. The UK Environment Agency said it was \"impressed by the accuracy\" of the approach. \"We welcome any tool that prevents pollution,\" the agency said. The researchers, who published their study in the journal Clean Water, trained a computer algorithm to recognise, through the pattern of flow through a treatment plant, when a spill was happening. Algorithms are software-based instructions for solving a problem. image captionThe River Wharfe in Ilkley recently became the first in England to be designated a bathing site, meaning its pollution levels will be monitored What constitutes a 'spill'? Wastewater treatment plants are permitted to release untreated sewage into rivers when there is exceptional rainfall. Storm tanks at a plant can become overwhelmed with rainwater and untreated wastewater overflows from the tanks into waterways. But there has been concern among environmental scientists and campaigners about the frequency of such raw sewage overflows. image captionHeavy rain causes much high volumes of water to enter treatment plants Christine Colvin, from the Rivers Trust charity, told BBC News: \"We put together the first national map of sewer overspills into English rivers last year, [and] I think we were all shocked at how much, and how widespread, raw sewage pollution is in our rivers. Prof Andrew Singer, of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), said the new approach was intended to establish an accurate measure of \"how much... under-reporting [of spills] might there be\". \"We wanted to bring new technology to assist with transparency and enforcement around water quality,\" he said. How can artificial intelligence help? The research - led by Prof Peter Hammond, also from the UKCEH - used a pattern recognition algorithm originally developed for medical genetics. \"Previously, I was using machine learning to detect subtle differences in the shape of children's faces to help diagnose certain genetic conditions,\" he said. \"Instead of mapping the 3D shape of a face, here we have the shape of the flow through a wastewater treatment works.\" While that may seem like a departure, the pattern recognition and machine learning approach works in the same way. As the name suggests, pattern recognition is a way of using computing to detect regular or repeating elements in data. Machine learning is an approach to detecting those patterns using algorithms that improve automatically, through experience and through the analysis of data. The researchers spent years gathering data about flow rates in two treatment plants - teaching the algorithm to recognise the \"shape of the flow\" when a plant was operating normally and when it was spilling untreated wastewater. image captionThe UK government is exploring the monitoring of wastewater for early signals of coronavirus outbreaks \"It builds up knowledge and then you test it,\" said Prof Singer. \"You basically give it all the data and say, 'can you find the spills'?\" Using 11 years of flow data from two plants, which the researchers did not identify in their study, the algorithm \"recognised\" 926 cases where untreated sewage was being released for at least three hours. media captionWatch: A look under the microscope to discover the hidden microplastics lurking in our waters The researchers say that water companies around the UK could put a similar approach in place at any plant to detect \"spills that appear to be going unnoticed and unreported\". The Environment Agency agreed there were \"good opportunities should water companies wish to consider the model as a planning tool to help manage pollution and prevent incidents from occurring\". Prof Singer added: \"I have spent my career understanding the effects of pollution on our environment and to remedy the problems, or at least, understanding better to inform people who make decisions. \"And we need to sort out the raw sewage problem that we have in the UK.\" Ms Colvin added: \"Fixing the problem is not going to be easy because it's going to require extensive investment in both old and new sewerage infrastructure and rethinking how we manage rainfall runoff in our towns and cities. \"But we cannot afford the polluting impact on our waterways if we want to be able to use them safely for recreation, and if we want to enable a truly green recovery that brings back wildlife into our rivers.\" In its response to the study, the industry body, Water UK, told BBC News it would be investing \u00a31.1bn over the next five years \"in improving storm overflows and wastewater treatment works\". \"Many companies are already employing AI techniques in order to manage their assets,\" a Water UK spokesperson added. \"We will continue to explore new and innovative techniques to enhance the health of rivers further.\"", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Hammond": [41.605380000000025, -87.50892999999996]}}, {"headline": "Why science could free Australian 'serial killer'", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-australia-56355695", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17F5E/production/_117524189_gettyimages-539496107.jpg", "text": "Kathleen Folbigg: Could science free Australian jailed for killing babies? Imagine for a moment what it must feel like if, as a mother, you give birth to four children, one after another, each of whom, as infants, dies from natural causes over a 10-year period. Then imagine being wrongly accused of smothering them all and being sentenced to 30 years in jail for four terrible crimes you did not commit. That narrative is emerging as potentially the true story of Kathleen Folbigg, an Australian mother from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales (NSW). Branded at her trial in 2003 as \"Australia's worst female serial killer\", Folbigg has already spent nearly 18 years in prison after being found guilty of the manslaughter of her firstborn Caleb, and the murder of her three subsequent children, Patrick, Sarah and Laura. But now, fresh scientific evidence is turning this case on its head. Last week a petition signed by 90 eminent scientists, science advocates and medical experts was handed to the Governor of NSW, requesting a pardon for Folbigg and her immediate release. Among the signatories were two Nobel laureates and two Australians of the Year, a former chief scientist, and the president of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor John Shine, who commented: \"Given the scientific and medical evidence that now exists in this case, signing this petition was the right thing to do.\" If Folbigg is freed and her convictions are overturned, her ordeal will be seen as the worst miscarriage of justice in Australia's history - worse even than the case of Lindy Chamberlain, who served three years in prison after being wrongly convicted of murdering her baby, Azaria, at Uluru. image copyrightThe Sydney Morning Herald/Getty Images image captionKathleen Folbigg (left) at her murder trial in 2003 The petition exposes a troubling gulf in this case between science and the law. Over several appeals and a detailed inquiry which re-examined Folbigg's convictions in 2019, Australia's judges have resolutely rejected the notion of reasonable doubt in her case, giving greater weight to the circumstantial evidence presented at her trial, and the ambiguous entries which she made in contemporaneous diaries. \"It remains that the only conclusion reasonably open is that somebody intentionally caused harm to the children, and smothering was the obvious method,\" said Reginald Blanch, a former judge who led the inquiry. \"The evidence pointed to no person other than Ms Folbigg.\" The NSW government further assured the public two years ago \"that no stone has been left unturned\". But the science, increasingly, points to the conclusion that there must be reasonable doubt about her convictions. \"The science in this case is compelling and cannot be ignored,\" says human geneticist and researcher Professor Jozef Gecz. Child and public health researcher Professor Fiona Stanley says: \"It is deeply concerning that medical and scientific evidence has been ignored, in preference of circumstantial evidence. We now have an alternative explanation for the death of the Folbigg children.\" That alternative explanation lies in the recent discovery of a genetic mutation in Kathleen Folbigg and her two daughters which, the scientists say, was \"likely pathogenic\" and which they believe caused the deaths of the two girls, Sarah and Laura. A different genetic mutation has been discovered in the two boys, Caleb and Patrick, although the scientists acknowledge that here, further research is needed. You might also be interested in: The initial discovery of the two girls' mutant gene, CALM2 G114R, was made in 2019 by a team led by Carola Vinuesa, a professor of immunology and genomic medicine at the Australian National University, and a driving force behind the petition calling for Folbigg's release. \"We found a novel, never-before reported mutation in Sarah and Laura that had been inherited from Kathleen,\" Professor Vinuesa told the BBC. \"The variant was in a gene called CALM2 (that encodes for calmodulin). Calmodulin variants can cause sudden cardiac death.\" In November last year, scientists from Australia, Denmark, France, Italy, Canada and the US reported further findings in the prestigious medical journal, Europace, published by the European Society of Cardiology. image copyrightANU image captionProf Carola Vinuesa's research led to the discovery of the mutant gene A team in Denmark, led by Aalborg University Professor Michael Toft Overgaard, conducted experiments designed to test the pathogenicity of the CALM2 variant. They found that the effects of the Folbigg mutation were as severe as those of other known CALM variants, which regularly cause cardiac arrests and sudden death, including in young children while asleep. The scientists stated: \"We consider the variant likely precipitated the natural deaths of the two female children.\" Both girls were suffering from infections before they died, and the scientists suggested that: \"A fatal arrhythmic event may have been triggered by their intercurrent infections.\" The scientists also reported that Caleb and Patrick each carried two rare variants in BSN, a gene shown to cause early onset lethal epilepsy in mice. The recent genetic discoveries follow in the footsteps of earlier expert medical opinions which support the theory that all four children died from natural causes. Professor Stephen Cordner, a Melbourne based forensic pathologist, re-examined the children's autopsies in 2015, concluding that: \"There is no positive forensic pathology support for the contention that any or all of these children have been killed.\" He added: \"There are no signs of smothering.\" Three years later, in 2018, forensic pathologist, Matthew Orde, Clinical Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: \"Fundamentally, I'm in agreement with Professor Cordner, in that all four of these child deaths could be explained by natural causes.\" Now, as Lindy Chamberlain did before her, Kathleen Folbigg bides her time in jail, awaiting the outcome of the petition and a recent hearing in the NSW Court of Appeal. She continues to protest her innocence.

Now that Democratic nominee Joe Biden \u2014 who schooled his opponent on the subject during the final presidential debate \u2014 has secured the electoral votes to become the next commander-in-chief, environmental justice advocates across the country are expressing excitement about the steps the new administration is likely to take to protect vulnerable communities from the effects of pollution and climate change. This optimism is guarded, however, given the immense challenge of reversing the environmental damage abetted by the administration of President Donald Trump. \u201cThe presidential election results are a critical victory for the climate movement,\u201d Arielle Swernoff, lead communications strategist at the environmental justice coalition New York Renews, told Grist. \u201cWe now have a president we can effectively organize to act swiftly and justly on climate, and to take much-needed federal action to build a just, green recovery to our current interlocking COVID-19 and climate crises.\u201d Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy North Carolina environmental justice advocate Omega Wilson told Grist he was thrilled that Biden and Harris won the election \u2014 but it\u2019s a victory tempered by the sobering reality of the work that is still ahead. At age 70, Wilson has lived long enough to witness the election of multiple presidents who sought to advance racial equity, from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. These presidents were swept into office with the support of some of the poorest and most disadvantaged communities, he said, yet very few of the promises made on the campaign trail translated into healthier and more prosperous lives at the local level. \u201cPeople are voting hoping that things are going to change where they live, where they walk, where they work,\u201d said Wilson, who co-founded the West End Revitalization Association, a community development corporation in Mebane, North Carolina, that has worked since 1994 to convince local municipalities to deliver basic public services such as sewer lines, city water lines, and paved streets to neglected, historically African American communities. The question, said Wilson, is whether the Biden-Harris administration can take corrective action at the ground-level to provide safe environments and clean water to all Americans, and to reduce exposure to hazardous waste, pollution, and landfills in communities of color. It\u2019s a point Wilson said he\u2019s emphasized for almost three decades working on environmental justice issues at the local, state, and federal levels. After the election of President Barack Obama, Wilson was selected to participate in a private forum of environmental justice experts gathered to advise the incoming president on how to address environmental justice and racial disparities across the country. After President Trump took office, Wilson watched with dismay as Trump dismantled or rolled back safeguards put in place under Obama to protect waterways, reduce emissions, and provide oversight of polluting industries. Twelve years after that forum, he understands how much work it will take \u2014 not just to reestablish the standards set under the Obama administration, but to set new priorities as well. So after the major news outlets announced on Saturday that Biden had won enough electoral college votes to assume the presidency, Wilson got right to work sending emails, setting up phone calls, and discussing how to help the new administration tackle its priorities, such as passing environmental justice legislation in Congress. It\u2019s meant late nights and early morning hours fueled by a lot of coffee and plagued by furrowed brows and headaches, he noted wryly. \u201cMy excitement and my wife\u2019s excitement and some of my friends\u2019 excitement is not so much jubilation like we see on television,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cMy mind goes directly back to the work we have to do to create a measurable outcome at the ground level.\u201d In states like New Jersey, where environmental justice advocates have successfully pushed for the passage of more stringent environmental laws to protect public health and communities of color burdened by decades of pollution, activists hope that a Biden-Harris administration will be more aligned with those communities that are already taking action to hold polluters accountable. Earlier this year, New Jersey state legislators passed a landmark law that requires the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection to consider the cumulative effects of pollution on overburdened communities when considering granting permits to industrial facilities such as power plants and incinerators. However, even when activists make progress at the municipal and state level, their efforts can be stymied in cases where the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the final say, such as in the oversight of contaminated Superfund sites. \u201cIf we have a federal government that\u2019s also doing what we\u2019re doing locally and statewide, it sends a clear message [to polluters] that you\u2019re not going to be allowed to come in and do business as you always have done in the past,\u201d said Kim Thompson-Gaddy, an environmental justice organizer for Clean Water Action of New Jersey, a grassroots organizing group. Thompson-Gaddy, who also serves as vice chair of the state Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s Environmental Justice Advisory Council, said that she\u2019s elated to have a president-elect who has prioritized restoring critical environmental and public health protections, citing Biden\u2019s plans to address water pollution and rejoin the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement. \u201cJust to start there is a breath of fresh air,\u201d said Thompson-Gaddy. But she\u2019s especially heartened that Biden says he wants to hold polluters accountable by enforcing existing environmental laws, because that enforcement will complement the work activists are doing in their communities to reduce emissions and address contamination. In Newark, home to the country\u2019s third largest port, frontline communities experience both the benefits and the downsides of a port that\u2019s both the economic engine for the state, but also what Thompson-Gaddy calls a \u201cdeath zone\u201d for people who live in nearby neighborhoods such as South Ward. Community organizers have worked to mobilize and inform residents on the importance of removing lead from water pipes that provide drinking water, as well as the need to establish zero-emission zones and convert the pollution-heavy diesel trucks that frequent the port to an all-electric fleet.

That could be transformative in our neighborhoods and in our cities,\u201d said Gaddy, who is also coordinator of the South Ward Environmental Alliance in Newark. Judith Enck, a former EPA regional administrator, is also cautiously optimistic for the incoming Biden-Harris administration. She believes that achieving environmental justice in the U.S. is possible, but she wants to see special efforts put towards protecting frontline communities of color from the climate crisis. \u201cEvery single thing that the EPA and other federal agencies do, must be viewed through the lense of environmental justice and children\u2019s health,\u201d Enck wrote in an email to Grist. She emphasized that the shift toward environmental justice needs to happen in other government agencies besides the EPA, such as the Department of Justice, the Treasury Department, and any other agency that funds future economic development projects. \u201cEvery environmental enforcement case that is filed needs to be decided in a way that answers the fundamental question: What will this decision mean for the health and safety of people living in low-income communities and communities of color?\u201d wrote Enck, who is now a visiting professor at Bennington College in Vermont.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Wilson": [35.721960000000024, -77.91636999999997], "New York": [40.71455000000003, -74.00713999999994], "Newark": [40.73197000000005, -74.17420999999996], "Obama": [35.49561405000003, 135.74662967000006], "West End": [50.927310000000034, -1.3298999999999523]}}, {"headline": "Government U-turn puts new coal mine on hold", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56364306", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6ADA/production/_117545372_mediaitem117545371.jpg", "text": "Prof Rebecca Willis and Prof Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University say the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than a million households.

It\u2019s also easy to store on board and, unlike batteries or tanks of hydrogen, it doesn\u2019t take away too much space from the cargo hold. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy Maersk\u2019s plan to run its container ship on sustainably sourced methanol marks a key milestone for the emerging fuel. Cargo shipping is the linchpin of the global economy, with tens of thousands of vessels hauling goods, food, and raw materials across the water every day. The industry accounts for nearly 3 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, a number that\u2019s expected to rise if ships keep using the same dirty fuels, according to the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, the United Nations body that regulates the industry. The IMO aims to reduce total shipping emissions by at least 50 percent from 2008 levels by 2050, and to completely decarbonize ships by the end of this century. The policy is accelerating efforts to test, pilot, and scale up more sustainable fuels. \u201cA lot of [cargo] carriers and technology providers are trying to figure out what the alternative to bunker fuel is,\u201d said Dan Rutherford, who directs the marine and aviation programs at the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, in California. Methanol, or CH\u2083OH, is primarily used to make chemicals for plastics, paints, and cosmetics. It\u2019s also considered a top candidate for cleaning up cargo ships in the near term, along with liquefied natural gas \u2014 a fuel that produces little air pollution but ultimately results in higher emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Long term, however, the leading contenders are likely to be ammonia and hydrogen, two zero-carbon fuels in earlier stages of development. At the moment, about a dozen chemical tankers burn methanol in their engines, with others soon to launch. But those vessels use conventional methanol, which is made from coal or natural gas. Maersk\u2019s new container ship would be the first commercial vessel to run on green methanol specifically, said Kjeld Aabo, director of new technologies for MAN Energy Solutions, the manufacturer providing the engine. The biggest challenge, Maersk said, will be finding enough of the fuel to run its ship as planned. One of the world\u2019s largest container ships, the Majestic Maersk, at the quay of Langelinie in Copenhagen.AP Photo / POLFOTO, Rasmus Flindt Pedersen The green version of methanol comes in two varieties: bio-methanol or e-methanol. Bio-methanol can be made from biomass, such as crop waste and paper pulp, or it can come from biogases gathered at landfills and sewage plants. The organic material is fermented or subjected to high temperatures to produce synthetic gas, which is then processed in a reactor. In Montreal, Canada, bio-ethanol made by the cleantech company Enerkem is already being used to make chemicals for polyester fabrics and drink bottles. E-methanol is made by combining hydrogen with carbon dioxide. Ideally, the hydrogen involved is produced by using renewable electricity (thus the titular \u201cE\u201d) to split water molecules. The necessary carbon can be captured from the exhaust fumes of power plants or, increasingly, by sucking CO2 from the sky using direct air capture. A green methanol facility in Iceland sources its carbon from a nearby geothermal power plant; the product is subsequently blended with gasoline and used to reduce conventional cars\u2019 tailpipe pollution. The \u201cwell-to-wake\u201d emissions footprint of e-methanol can be \u201cvery close to zero\u201d if no fossil fuels are involved in the process, Rutherford said. His ICCT colleagues also analyzed bio-methanol from plant biomass; that fuel\u2019s overall emissions were 70 to 80 percent lower than those of marine gas oil, a petroleum product commonly used in ships. But making green methanol is extremely costly, and its overall production amounts to a trickle: about 220,000 metric tons every year, according to the Methanol Institute and the International Renewable Energy Agency. Even if that entire amount was used for shipping, it\u2019d amount to less than 1 percent of the industry\u2019s annual fuel consumption. Conventional methanol, by contrast, is widely available and relatively less expensive to make using fossil fuels. Global production nearly doubled over the last decade to more than 100 million metric tons annually, driven by Chinese manufacturers. Like its cleaner counterpart, fossil methanol doesn\u2019t produce harmful soot or particulate matter when burned. Yet it\u2019s not exactly a climate win. Methanol from natural gas actually increased well-to-wake emissions by up to 15 percent when compared to existing marine fuels, a 2018 study found. \u201cAs in all things fuels, the good stuff is not the cheap stuff,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cAnd the cheap stuff tends to be comparable in greenhouse gas emissions to heavy fuel oil today.\u201d For green methanol supplies to scale, a few key things need to happen, experts say. Regulators will need to set a price on carbon dioxide emissions or take similar measures to incentivize (or force) companies to buy cleaner fuels. Renewable electricity projects must continue to multiply, while carbon-capturing technologies will need to significantly scale to reduce their own costs. And, although methanol is similar to oil-based fuels, it\u2019s chemically different enough that the shipping industry will need to build specific fueling infrastructure for methanol in ports around the world. But, despite the challenges, shipping giants are installing methanol engines now to stay ahead of the curve, said Aabo of MAN Energy Solutions. Cargo ships are meant to last for roughly 20 years or longer, and climate regulations and fuel markets can both change dramatically in that amount of time. Companies can start with fossil methanol then switch to green as supplies become available. Or, since the same engines can also burn diesel fuel, companies might start with petroleum, then switch to methanol later on. If Maersk is unable to get enough sustainable fuel by 2023, its new ship has this fallback option \u2014 though using it would void the vessel\u2019s \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d credentials.

Before Covid-19, the famous tourist attraction would often be bustling with visitors but during what is the third national lockdown, the zoo currently hosts very few humans. The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) looks after 20,000 animals across two sites, the main one in Regent's Park and at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. ZSL relies heavily on ticket sales to fund its vital conservation work, but over the past year the charity has missed out on about \u00a320m of income. What does the future hold for one of the world's oldest zoos? 'Asiatic lions could become extinct' Kate Sanders, who has the fearsome-sounding job title of team leader of the predator section, worries about whether London Zoo can survive. \"The last year has been a really crazy year with us being shut for the majority of the time,\" the 37-year-old says. \"I think we've only been open for four months over a 12-month period and it is really worrying now. What is going to happen to the zoo? What is going to happen to all the wonderful animals we work with? \"I am really worried now that if we don't start getting visitors back in, to get some money to feed these animals and look after staff, we can't survive. We are a charity who have had funds coming in from amazing people who have been donating, but realistically it is just a drop in the ocean and we do need visitors to come back.\" image copyrightGetty Images image captionAsiatic lion Bhanu has been reluctant to mate with London Zoo's lionesses Zoos play a crucial role in conservation. Through a worldwide network, they move endangered animals around the globe for breeding. Ms Sanders says that in December the pandemic thwarted London Zoo's efforts to send three female Asiatic lions to Schwerin Zoo in northern Germany - the idea was to make room for a new mate for London's male lion, Bhanu. \"There are not many Asiatic lions left in the wild - I think only 450 in the world now,\" she says. \"Unfortunately, because of Covid the borders were shut for about two days between here and France, and they were meant to travel then. \"We had to stop the move as we weren't willing to take the risk that the lionesses might be on board a truck and not be able to cross the Channel to France.\" Staff have also been pruning Regent's Park's trees and bushes to provide food for the giraffes. Feeding the animals across both ZSL sites costs about \u00a31m a month. image copyrightReuters image captionIt's feeding time at the zoo It means staff like 24-year-old Joe Bostock-Jones are still reporting for duty each day. \"Animals need caring for whether people are coming or not,\" he says. \"It took a while for us to get used to the changes. We are quite a busy zoo, especially around March. The closure was announced on the evening [of 23 March] and the next day we were shut. I remember walking over to our mess room and it was just really weird and silent. \"At the start, we didn't think we'd be closed very long, A month or two later, it slowly dawned on us that this was going to be it for a while.\" 'We had to find the goats some company' image captionVeronica Heldt is the deputy leader of animal activities at London Zoo While the animals are being fed as well as they were before Covid-19, Veronica Heldt, 40, says some of them have noticed the lack of visitors. \"The pygmy goats definitely miss the public during lockdown,\" she says. \"At first they were lining up at the gate to their enclosure waiting for the public, who never turned up, meaning we had to step in.\" Zookeepers take it in turns to walk the goats around the site, giving them an opportunity to interact with other animals. \"The pigs, camels and even Max the eagle owl go for walks too,\" says Ms Heldt, who is the zoo's deputy leader of animal activities. \"It's enriching for all the animals they pass as well, and the goats even help the gardeners out with a lawn trim. \"Seeing the zoo empty of visitors is sad for us. A huge part of what we do is educating the public about animals and inspiring people from a young age to care about wildlife.\" 'It has been exhausting' image captionChief operating officer Kathryn England praised the \"exceptional\" efforts of the public, who have donated \u00a37m out of ZSL's \u00a312m fundraising target \"We are hopeful we can open up again shortly afterwards but that again will be with capacity limits and different ways of working, so it has a limit on the people we have through the doors.\" image copyrightGetty Images image captionYoda (pictured) and his father Jimmy are the only gibbons at London Zoo Ms England admits the 12 April opening date is only a hope at this stage, as it depends on Covid infection rates. \"One thing we have all learned is that until something is nailed down in black-and-white terms, we are not going to assume anything.

Now can he save the planet? After five days of nail-biting, anxiety-inducing ballot counting in half a dozen key swing states, Joe Biden has been declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election. And while Biden\u2019s victory will put an end to the notoriously anti-environment Trump era, it also comes with one burning question: Will the former vice president \u2014 who made climate change a centerpiece of his campaign \u2014 be able to push the country onto a safer, and cooler, path? \u201cA Biden win is a first step to a better future,\u201d said Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution, via email. \u201cBut we have a long road ahead of us.\u201d The stakes have never been higher. The United States is responsible for approximately 15 percent of the carbon dioxide spewing into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. Without dramatic action to slash those emissions in the coming years, the globe is expected to face dangerous levels of warming, combined with heat waves, runaway floods, and catastrophic wildfires. Scientists have recently been warned that another four more years of Trump could have terrible consequences: Michael Mann, an eminent climate scientist, portrayed it as \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy That\u2019s part of why Biden entered the general election with the most ambitious climate plan of any major presidential candidate \u2014 ever. The former vice president promised to spend $2 trillion on clean energy, create a new civilian \u201cclimate conversation corps,\u201d and completely eliminate emissions from the electricity sector by 2035. In a debate with Trump, he promised to \u201ctransition away from the oil industry,\u201d a remark previously considered unthinkable for a presidential candidate. Climate activist groups, like the youth-led Sunrise movement, initially scorned his plans \u2014 then joined him on the campaign trail. Those big plans seem to have energized voters. According to one NPR poll in September, a record 12 percent of voters (and 22 percent of Democrats) identified climate change as their number one issue in the presidential race \u2014 even in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. Early analysis from the nonprofit Environmental Voter Project showed that more than 500,000 \u201cenvironment-first\u201d voters cast their ballots in 2020 for the first time. Even on the morning of Election Day, some groups were already calling it \u201cthe first climate election.\u201d Now comes the hard part. The House of Representatives remains firmly in Democratic hands. But Democrats lostcrucial Senate races in Maine, Montana, and Iowa, likely leaving Biden with a divided Congress. With a Republican-controlled Senate, the new president will have to fight to get any legislation through \u2014 let alone a proposal to overhaul the country\u2019s energy policy. And attempts to regulate carbon emissions through executive action could be foiled by the new, highly conservative Supreme Court. That means Biden will probably focus first on undoing the damage of the Trump era. (Trump has repeatedly called human-induced warming a Chinese \u201choax,\u201d and suggested that supporters of the Green New Deal were going to \u201ctake out\u201d America\u2019s cows.) In 2017, Trump vowed to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Agreement, a move that, due to a combination of complex rules and random chance, was officially completed this week; Biden has said he will rejoin the agreement immediately after his inauguration in January. Trump dismantled at least 70 Obama-era environmental rules intended to keep fossil fuels in the ground and dangerous toxins out of American air and water; Biden has pledged to reverse as many of those actions as he can. Other climate-friendly initiatives \u2014 funding for renewable energy, or for building more efficient homes \u2014 will have to be wedged into spending bills, or otherwise snuck into legislation that could get through a Republican-led Senate. Biden might have an advantage in this, however: With 36 years in the Senate, he has more Congressional experience than any other president. To be sure, the results of the election weren\u2019t exactly what activists and advocates were hoping for. The next four years are more likely to feature incremental action than the sweeping dreams of the Green New Deal, and \u2014 much as in the Trump era \u2014 progress may be led by left-leaning states and big corporations willing to cut carbon. At the same time, the problem of climate change is becoming too big to ignore. In the past few months alone, there have been so many hurricanes that meteorologists started naming them after Greek letters. In September and October, fires over California, Oregon, and Colorado turned the skies a sickly, Blade Runner orange. As even ordinary Americans become tuned in to the issue, a victory for a presidential candidate who recognizes the scale of the problem looks like a necessary first step \u2014 that will still leave many wanting more. \u201cWhat we do in the next years and decades will affect the Earth for tens of thousands of years, if not longer,\u201d said Caldeira, the climate scientist.

Researchers at BayWa r.e., a German renewable energy company, scoured 1.3 trillion tweets, Reddit posts, news articles, and other publicly available sources, along with Google search data. They found that searches for global warming, once the most common phrase for our overheating planet, are down 73 percent since 2010. The older expression is simply going out of fashion. Climate change began to outpace global warming around 2015, and the newly popular climate crisis might someday catch up if current trends continue. It\u2019s another sign, researchers say, that the public is beginning to grasp the magnitude of the problem. The decline of global warming, which refers to an increase in planet-wide temperatures, has been a long time coming. Detractors have long complained that warming sounds warm and cozy, like hugs. It\u2019s also more narrow in meaning than climate change, which better captures the full range of effects that people are experiencing, from wilder wildfires to heftier hurricanes. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy \u201cGlobal warming can potentially be confusing for people, because while the warming happens at a global level, there\u2019s obviously local extreme weather dynamics that don\u2019t always correlate with warming,\u201d said Emma Frances Bloomfield, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She pointed to the freak winter storm in Texas last month: Some scientists say that warming patterns in the Arctic are sending frigid polar air south more often, leading to periods of extreme cold in parts of the United States. Climate change itself has been criticized for sounding too neutral \u2014 after all, change is often a good thing. Since 2019, activists and media organizations like the Guardian have been amping up the sense of gravity around the issue, switching up the lingo with climate crisis, climate emergency, climate breakdown, climate disruption, and global heating. BayWa r.e. had a hunch that this more dramatic vocabulary was catching on. \u201cClimate change felt like it got real, and people were talking about it in a different way, becoming more urgent,\u201d said Mark Cooper, the company\u2019s head of global communications.* \u201cSo we thought, well, is that actually the case?\u201d They found that the public is indeed using more urgent-sounding and active language. The growth in search terms such as take action \u201cshows a world that\u2019s increasingly thinking with proactivity and specific causes in mind, replacing the more general and vague warning of \u2018global warming\u2019 as an abstract concept,\u201d the report says. The total mentions of climate change grew year after year, more than doubling in 2019 when Swedish activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate strike turned into a global movement. Only in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic set in, did the total volume of the climate discussion die down. On Twitter, for example, the year brought a 41-percent plunge in posts about the climate. Amid this dramatic drop, however, the use of climate crisis actually increased by 17 percent. It\u2019s a similar story with climate action, which rose 47 percent. The effects of these alternative phrases have yet to be extensively studied, said Jill Hopke, an assistant professor of communication at DePaul University. \u201cThere\u2019s so little research on this topic,\u201d and not enough data to conclude how people are responding to it. More urgent language could motivate some to take action, but a few studiessuggest it could also backfire, prodding already doubtful people to deny the scientific consensus more vehemently. Describing our planetary problem as in crisis \u201cplays into the \u2018hysterical, alarmist\u2019 climate change discourse,\u201d Bloomfield said. Still, she thinks the shift from global warming to climate crisis is a positive development. As more and more people become concerned about climate change, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think those attacks are going to have as much staying power.\u201d The report has some limitations. It\u2019s not peer-reviewed, and with a big sample like this \u2014 with more than a trillion documents \u2014 some details might have been glossed over by Brandwatch, the platform used to analyze the data. \u201cIt\u2019s giving a good picture of the broad, sweeping conversation trends over time,\u201d Hopke said. \u201cBut what\u2019s lacking is that fine-grained analysis of what\u2019s actually the content of those conversations.\u201d Although climate change might not be consuming our conversation as much as it was in 2019, Bloomfield is encouraged by the connections people are making between the pandemic and the planetary crisis. The report found that the most popular news articles about climate change last year linked it with the pandemic \u2014 showing how carbon emissions dipped during the lockdowns last year, for instance, or how preserving forests could help stop the next pandemic.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Bloomfield": [40.79203000000007, -74.19536999999997], "University": [34.36515000000003, -89.53374999999994], "Las Vegas": [36.17193000000003, -115.14000999999996], "Texas": [31.46273304600004, -99.33305008999997]}}, {"headline": "Then and now: A 'megadrought' in California", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-56225862", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7B3A/production/_117364513_drought1600comp.jpg", "text": "Then and now: A 'megadrought' in California In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of extreme weather on a crucial reservoir that supplies water to millions of people in northern California. Lake Oroville plays a key role in California's complex water delivery system. Bidwell Marina at Lake Oroville, California A modern web browser and internet connection are required to view the image slider Drag button to see how extreme drought has affected lake July 2014July 2011 Source: Getty This 65km-square body of water north of Sacramento is the second-largest reservoir in California. Not only does Lake Oroville store water, it helps control flooding elsewhere in the region, assists with the maintenance of water quality and boosts the health of fisheries downstream. In 2014, more than 80% of California was in the grip of an \"extreme drought\". Against this backdrop, Oroville's capacity fell to 30% - a historic low level. As the water level receded to hundreds of feet below normal levels, ramps and roads no longer reached the water's edge. More worryingly, the reservoir - when full - provided enough water for an estimated seven million households, as well as providing power for hydroelectricity facilities and irrigation for agricultural land. 'Unusually destructive' The dry conditions didn't start in 2014, however, there had been a drought for years prior to Oroville recording its historic low level. Indeed, the US space agency's Earth Observatory had warned that the multi-year drought was having a wider impact on the region. Among its effects was a contribution to \"unusually active and destructive\" fire seasons and poor yields from agricultural land. \"There is strong evidence from climate models and centuries of tree ring data that suggest about one-third to one-half of the severity of the current drought can be attributed to climate change,\" observed Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist from Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. Agency scientists added that the data suggested a \"megadrought\" might already be underway in this region - and that it could last for decades. The latest update from the US Drought Monitor in December 2020, showed that much of the country's western states were gripped by extreme or exceptional drought, with Nevada, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, Colorado and western Texas being the worst affected. image copyrightReuters image captionThe emergency spillway at the dam was predicted to collapse The Drought Monitor releases maps showing the parts of the country with prolonged shortages in the water supply. It is produced jointly by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). From one extreme... Climate change is not just about a warmer world, it also means that the planet will see more extreme environmental conditions and weather. So, for example, episodes of flooding will increase, as well as episodes of droughts. Lake Oroville was a perfect illustration of how these extremes can threaten our existing infrastructure. While the lake's levels reached a historic low in 2014, the reservoir's vast embankment dam - the tallest in the US - was pushed to breaking point in February 2017. Following fierce storms in the surrounding mountains, water was flowing into the lake at a rate of roughly one-and-a-half Olympic-size swimming pools each second. media captionWhat went wrong with US dam? Communities downstream had been evacuated, with more than 100,000 people being ordered to leave their homes. Officials were struggling to allow water to flow out of the lake because the main spillway - a structure that provides controlled releases of water - and the emergency spillway had been eroded and damaged. Yet they had to continue sending water down the valley because the reservoir was reaching capacity and there was a sense that there could be a \"catastrophic failure\" in the structure. In the space of two years, the lake went from an unprecedented low to a capacity that had not been experienced before. Water cascaded over the emergency spillways, which had not previously been required. Traditionally, the lake was replenished by meltwater from a thawing snowpack in surrounding mountains, whose river systems fed the reservoir. June was the month when the reservoir was expected to reach its yearly maximum level. However, in 2017, it was rain that caused the intense water flow. The reservoir had reached capacity in February, rather than the middle of the year, as usually happened. Scientists again suggested that the event fitted into the paradigm of a warming world. Speaking at the time to the Guardian newspaper, Prof Roger Bale, from the University of California Merced, explained: \"With a warmer climate, we get these winter storms, which dump rain rather than snow.\" image copyrightReuters image captionCalifornia Department of Water Resources officials closely monitored the cascade over the reservoir's damaged spillway The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that the \"frequency and intensity of droughts, storms and extreme weather events are increasingly likely above 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels)\". Failure to keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5C, as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is likely to result in more of the world's reservoirs or flood defences being tested to breaking point. This is a stark warning for world leaders, who will be gathering once again this year at the UN's annual climate summit (COP26) - to be held in Glasgow. The meeting, which had to be postponed by a year because of Covid, will seek to raise global ambition on tackling climate change - with a view to keeping temperature rise within the 1.5C limit.

Lockdowns around the world led to an unprecedented fall in emissions of about 7 percent in 2020, or about 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2, but reductions of between 1 billion and 2 billion tonnes are needed every year of the next decade to have a good chance of holding temperature rises to within 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees C of preindustrial levels, as required by the Paris Agreement. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy Research published on Wednesday shows that countries were beginning to slow their rates of greenhouse gas emissions before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, but not to the levels needed to avert climate breakdown. Since lockdowns were eased in many countries last year, there have been strong signs that emissions will rise again to above 2019 levels, severely damaging the prospects of fulfilling the Paris goals. Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, the lead author of the study, said the world stood at a crucial point as governments poured money into the global economy to cope with the impacts of the pandemic. \u201cWe need a cut in emissions of about the size of the fall [from the lockdowns] every two years, but by completely different methods,\u201d she said. Governments must prioritize climate action in their efforts to recover from the pandemic, she said. \u201cWe have failed to understand in the past that we can\u2019t have tackling climate change as a side issue. It can\u2019t be about one law or policy, it has to be put at the heart of all policy,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery strategy and every plan from every government must be consistent with tackling climate change.\u201d \u201cThere is a real contradiction between what governments are saying they are doing to do [to generate a green recovery], and what they are doing,\u201d said Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9. \u201cThat is very worrisome.\u201d Glen Peters of the Cicero center for climate research in Norway, who coauthored the paper, said structural changes were needed for economies around the world to move away from fossil fuels and other high-carbon activities. \u201cEmissions were lower in 2020 as fossil fuel infrastructure was used less, not because infrastructure was closed down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen fossil fuel infrastructure is put into use again, there is a risk of a big rebound in emissions in 2021, as was seen in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2009.\u201d The paper, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows that many of the world\u2019s major economies were reducing their emissions before the pandemic. The Global Carbon Project, a team of scientists from around the world, found that 64 countries had cut their emissions in the period between 2016 and 2019 compared with 2011 to 2015, but 150 countries showed an increase in emissions in the latter period. Countries must urgently intensify their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, said Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9. The study shows that the annual rate of emissions cuts must increase roughly tenfold from 160 million tonnes a year in high-income countries before the pandemic struck. In lower-income countries, there was no real slowdown in emissions between 2016 and 2019 compared with the previous two five-year periods. Such countries must also drastically slow their rate of emissions increase in the future if the Paris goals are to be met. Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer in climate at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study, said governments were in danger of slipping back on their climate commitments as a result of the pandemic and the rush to restart stalled economies. \u201cGovernments need to use their recovery stimulus in smart, future-proof ways [but] other analysis has shown very few governments are taking this opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently, the actions and investments of many governments in response to COVID-19 are driving emissions in the opposite direction.\u201d Dave Reay, a professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, also not involved in the study, said: \u201cAlready there are signs that instead of build back better, it is more often a case of build back, whatever. If we are to have any chance of getting back on track to meet the Paris goals, the route out of the pandemic must be both global and green.\u201d", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Cicero": [41.85120000000006, -87.74672999999996], "Paris": [48.85717000000005, 2.3414000000000215], "London": [51.50642000000005, -0.1272099999999341], "University": [34.36515000000003, -89.53374999999994], "Edinburgh": [55.95438000000007, -3.201439999999934]}}, {"headline": "What happened at Fukushima 10 years ago?", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-56252695", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9511/production/_117516183_womanreuters.jpg", "text": "Fukushima disaster: What happened at the nuclear plant? image captionThe 2011 earthquake was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan Ten years ago, on a Friday afternoon in March, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan struck off the country's eastern coast. The 9.0-magnitude quake was so forceful it shifted the Earth off its axis. It triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map. At the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the gigantic wave surged over defences and flooded the reactors, sparking a major disaster. Authorities set up an exclusion zone which grew larger and larger as radiation leaked from the plant, forcing more than 150,000 people to evacuate from the area. A decade later, that zone remains in place and many residents have not returned. Authorities believe it will take up to 40 years to finish the work, which has already cost Japan trillions of yen. Where is the plant? The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is in the town of Okuma, in Fukushima Prefecture. It sits on the country's east coast, about 220km (137 miles) north-east of the capital Tokyo. On 11 March 2011 at 14:46 local time (05:46 GMT) the earthquake - known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, or the 2011 Tohoku earthquake - struck east of the city of Sendai, 97km north of the plant. Residents had just 10 minutes warning before the tsunami hit the coast. Overall almost half-a-million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident. What happened at Fukushima? Systems at the nuclear plant detected the earthquake and automatically shut down the nuclear reactors. Emergency diesel generators turned on to keep coolant pumping around the cores, which remain incredibly hot even after reactions stop. But soon after a wave over 14 metres (46ft) high hit Fukushima. The water overwhelmed the defensive sea wall, flooding the plant and knocking out the emergency generators. image copyrightGetty Images image captionThe tsunami overcame the sea wall and hit the plant image copyrightGetty Images image captionThe damage led to nuclear meltdowns and a number of hydrogen explosions Workers rushed to restore power, but in the days that followed the nuclear fuel in three of the reactors overheated and partly melted the cores - something known as a nuclear meltdown. The plant also suffered a number of chemical explosions which badly damaged the buildings. Radioactive material began leaking into the atmosphere and the Pacific Ocean, prompting the evacuations and an ever-widening exclusion zone. How many people were hurt? There were no deaths immediately during the nuclear disaster. At least 16 workers were injured in the explosions, while dozens more were exposed to radiation as they worked to cool the reactors and stabilise the plant. Three people were reportedly taken to hospital after high-level exposure. Long-term effects of the radiation are a matter of debate. The World Health Organization (WHO) released a report in 2013 that said the disaster will not cause any observable increase in cancer rates in the region. Scientists both inside and outside Japan believe that aside from the region immediately around the plant, the risks of radiation remain relatively low. On 9 March 2021, ahead of the 10-year anniversary, a UN report said there had been \"no adverse health effects\" documented among Fukushima residents directly related to the radiation from the disaster. Any future radiation-related health effects were \"unlikely to be discernible\", it said. Who was at fault? Critics blamed the lack of preparedness for the event, as well as a muddled response from both the plant operator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) and the government. An independent investigation set up by Japan's parliament concluded that Fukushima was \"a profoundly man-made disaster\", blaming the energy company for failing to meet safety requirements or to plan for such an event. However, in 2019 a Japanese court cleared three former Tepco executives of negligence in what was the only criminal case to come out of the disaster. image copyrightGetty Images image captionThe disaster prompted a wave of public anger and a move away from nuclear power in Japan Major challenges remain. Tens of thousands of workers will be needed over the next 30 to 40 years to safely remove nuclear waste, fuel rods and more than one million tons of radioactive water still kept at the site. But some residents have decided never to return because they fear radiation, have built new lives elsewhere or don't want to go back to where the disaster hit. image copyrightReuters image captionHisae Unuma wears a protective suit as she prays at her family's graveyard 2.5km from the power plant last month", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"March": [52.55128000000008, 0.0885000000000673], "Tokyo": [35.68945633000004, 139.6917160900001], "Sendai": [38.26821957000004, 140.86940215000004]}}, {"headline": "Nostalgia Week", "url": "https://grist.org/series/nostalgia-week/", "image_url": "https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nostalgia1-still.jpg", "text": "Nostalgia Week It\u2019s been a helluva year \u2014 so rather than just reflecting on all that went down in 2020, we\u2019re going back a bit further and seeking comfort via nostalgia.

Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy The area is also home to the descendants of those enslaved workers, who studies show have suffered and died from cancer, diabetes, and respiratory diseases at higher rates than most of the country, and higher than Louisiana as a whole. The risk of cancer from air pollution in the corridor is 95 percent higher than in most of the country, and during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, death rates from the virus soared. \u201cThis form of environmental racism poses serious and disproportionate threats to the enjoyment of several human rights of its largely African American residents, including the right to equality and non-discrimination, the right to life, the right to health, right to an adequate standard of living and cultural rights,\u201d the U.N. experts said in the report. \u201cThey\u2019re killing us over here in Cancer Alley,\u201d Sharon Lavigne, the founder of community advocacy group RISE St. James, said Tuesday. Until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers suspended permits in November, Taiwanese industrial giant Formosa Plastics Corporation was building what would have been one of the world\u2019s largest plastic manufacturing plants in the region. The project, approved in 2018, would have more than doubled the cancer risks in St. James Parish, where census data show roughly half the population is Black and nearly 17 percent falls below the poverty line. But using data from the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.N. researchers found that the cancer risks for the predominantly Black parts of the parish were up to 105 cases per million residents, while areas where the population was mostly white ranged from 60 cases to 75 cases per million. As more petrochemical plants open, the U.N. report estimated that the combined carbon dioxide emissions per year in a single parish would exceed those of 113 countries. Unmentioned in the report was the effort over the past year by Louisiana lawmakers to squelch protest by the vibrant community activist groups in the pollution-plagued region. In May, the state legislature passed a bill that would have required judges to impose a mandatory three-year minimum prison sentence with hard labor on protesters convicted of trespassing on industrial property or infrastructure. That could include almost anywhere in a state with 125,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines. But advocates in St. James Parish took the threat personally. For years, community groups that included the descendants of enslaved Black workers had protested plans to build the Formosa plastics plant on the site of an unmarked slave burial ground. If police arrested them during a routine spiritual ceremony to honor the dead and demand special designation for the area, the bill would have subjected them to severe penalties.

Mr Kerry, a former US Secretary of State appointed to the role by Mr Biden in November, spent several hours in Downing Street with Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who is chairing November's gathering. Mr Kerry was also due to meet other senior UK figures, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, and Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. On Tuesday, climate diplomacy sees him in Paris and Brussels for talks with European leaders, who have been praised for their recent target to cut emissions 55% on 1990 levels.

There is positive news too, from Brazil, which \u2013 under US pressure \u2013 says its previous stance blocking climate talks was misunderstood. Monday's meetings may go some way to helping the UK focus its objectives for the November gathering. Ministers were accused recently by MPs on the Business and Energy Select Committee of failing to set clear goals. The committee said the key areas identified by the UK for action - adaptation and resilience; nature based solutions; energy transitions; clean transport and switching the finance system to low-carbon investments - were too broad and \"without clear measures for success\". 'Up for grabs' It said more focus needed to be given to the \"overriding necessity\" of agreeing deliverable policies that keep global temperature rises to as close to 1.5C as possible. Nick Mabey, from the think tank e3g, told the BBC there was the potential to achieve multiple goals \u2013 including banning new coal power plants, ending banks' fossil fuel investment and supporting poorer nations to adapt - and that these should be debated publicly. \u201cThis debate is up for grabs\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be a public debate because we\u2019re talking out how to change whole economies. A lot of the outcomes from Glasgow will be decided in the court of public opinion.\u201d John Kerry's meetings with the UK politicians who will be running the COP26 summit may help bring some much-needed clarity to efforts on this side of the Atlantic. But he will also be assessing just how much political capital Team Biden should invest in Team Boris. So far, the messaging from the UK on what COP26 can realistically achieve has been muddled. If every country is going to put a new climate plan on the table before Glasgow, what's the actual point of the meeting? Mr Kerry will also be assessing how much diplomatic heavy lifting he should undertake on behalf of the Brits. To give Glasgow a chance, both India and China will have to come up with significant advances on their current actions on carbon. Others, including the Saudis and the Brazilians, will have to show flexibility. Kerry's involvement may be critical in delivering these outcomes. But his impression of the British effort will also influence events back home. President Biden is organising a climate summit of world leaders for 22 April.

The world is crazy right now, and the stakes are high: just, you know, our entire frickin\u2019 future. Our newsfeeds are full of denial, delay, and doom that make us want to scream into our pillows. But that\u2019s just the old story. At Fix, we are telling the new story, of a path to a clean, green, and just future, and the people who are driving it. Our mission is to make the story of a better world so irresistible, you want it right now. With that goal in mind, we decided to launch our first foray into the world of hopeful, forward-looking fiction \u2014 to inspire visions of the future that haven\u2019t even been dreamt up yet, and welcome more voices into the climate conversation. Join this uprising of imagination, and help us turn the page on earth\u2019s next chapter. Nuts & bolts Entry is free! Submissions close April 12, 11:59 p.m. U.S. Pacific Standard Time.

If a story is accepted for publication, Grist retains the first serial rights of the work to publish, produce, reproduce, distribute, and market. All other remaining rights revert to the author upon publication. Creative premise Easy peasy: Envision the next 180 years of equitable climate progress. What will the world look like in the year 2200 \u2014 or anywhere between then and now? How will we move around the cities of the future? What will we eat, drink, wear, use, and live in? How will we hold our relationships to land, resources, and one another? What kind of a world do you, a future ancestor, want to build? This is your opportunity to build it \u2014 on paper. Stories should be set anywhere between the present day and the year 2200, and should show our path to a clean, green, and just future. (Of course, we don\u2019t expect your story to be totally rosy or pollyannaish. 180 years of equitable climate progress will involve hard work and struggle, and we invite you to show that, too.) Imagine 2200 draws inspiration from Afrofuturism, as well as Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, disabled, feminist, and queer futures. The contest is also grounded in hopepunk and solarpunk \u2014 literary genres that uplift equitable climate solutions and continued service to one\u2019s community, even in the face of despair. We\u2019ll be reading for the following core elements: Hope Intersectionality Resilience A society that is radically different from the one we live in today, and how we got there A focus on climate, with creative and clearly articulated solutions that put people and planet first We will also judge submissions based on the quality of artistic voice, originality, craftsmanship, and technique, and the depth of environmental, scientific, historical, and/or cultural background that informs the story.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Of": [40.94371000000007, 40.26192000000003]}}, {"headline": "A showdown in Nevada could determine the future of electric vehicles in the US", "url": "https://grist.org/climate/the-west-has-a-new-front-in-the-war-over-electric-cars/", "image_url": "https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thacker-pass2.jpg", "text": "The Battle of Thacker Pass When Edward Bartell first learned that a lithium mine might be moving into his remote corner of northern Nevada, the longtime cattle rancher wasn\u2019t upset. \u201cI was actually kind of excited about it,\u201d Bartell said. He knew that lithium is a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles and the power grid, and he knew the United States is going to need a lot of it to transition off fossil fuels. But as Bartell started learning more about the proposed Thacker Pass mine \u2014 which would be the second, and by far the largest, lithium mine in the United States \u2014 he grew increasingly worried about its impacts on his ranching business and nearby ecosystems. In spite of the numerous concerns Bartell and others raised during a comment period in which the government solicited opinions about the proposed mine project from members of the public, Thacker Pass received speedy review and was approved by the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, on January 15, the Trump administration\u2019s final Friday in office. Construction of mining facilities and \u201cpre-stripping\u201d to expose lithium-rich ores could begin later this year. Bartell is now suing the federal government to try to stop that from happening. In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Nevada in February, Bartell alleges that the BLM broke the law when it approved the mine\u2019s plan to operate on federal lands based on a \u201cone sided, deeply flawed, and incomplete\u201d environmental impact statement that downplayed the project\u2019s likely effects on groundwater, streams, and a threatened species of trout. Bartell\u2019s goal? Get the federal government to do a more thorough review of the project. If the mine is allowed to move forward without a new assessment, Bartell worries that its surroundings will become an arid, polluted wasteland. Edward Bartell stands in a field of vegetation he says will be impacted by groundwater pumping from the proposed lithium mine at Thacker Pass. Courtesy of Edward Bartell Bartell isn\u2019t the only one taking the BLM to court over Thacker Pass. A couple of weeks after Bartell filed his suit, a coalition of conservation groups filed a separate federal lawsuit asserting that the BLM \u201cswept under the rug\u201d a host of environmental impacts \u2014 including groundwater pollution that will exceed federal standards and \u201csevere\u201d impacts to sensitive wildlife like the greater sage-grouse \u2014 in its \u201crush\u201d to approve the project. The controversy over Thacker Pass highlights a much bigger challenge the Biden administration will have to grapple with in order to quickly transition the U.S. economy to carbon-free energy sources: How to acquire the vast mineral resources that are needed, such as metals needed for batteries, like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, without sacrificing biodiversity or the health of communities living nearby mining projects. Shoring up domestic supplies of these metals is a key concern for the new president, who recently issued an executive order focused on making supply chains more resilient and wrote, in an accompanying statement, that the U.S. \u201ccould better leverage our sizable lithium reserves\u201d to expand battery manufacturing. While the U.S. is poor in conventional sources of lithium like salt flat brines, it has sizable \u201cunconventional\u201d lithium resources, including geothermal brines and clays. But conservationists and grassroots environmental advocates say that if the administration doesn\u2019t figure out how to strike a balance between mining, environmental protection, and the wishes of rural and Indigenous communities, more and more flashpoints like Thacker Pass are coming. Indeed, hundreds of miles south, a second lithium battle is already heating up \u2014 this one pitting a proposed mine in Nevada\u2019s Silver Peak Range against conservationists who fear the project will drive a rare species of wildflower extinct. \u201cThere is a lot of pressure to extract materials for what we consider to be the new energy economy,\u201d said John Hadder, the executive director of Great Basin Resource Watch, one of the environmental nonprofits suing BLM over the Thacker Pass mine. \u201cBut we have to do it in a way which isn\u2019t business as usual.\u201d Situated less than 50 miles south of Nevada\u2019s border with Oregon in Humboldt County, the Thacker Pass region is a sea of sagebrush, scrublands, and grasslands that serves a wildlife corridor connecting two mountain ranges. It\u2019s home to pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, mule deer, and golden eagles. It includes federally designated \u201cpriority habitat management areas\u201d for the greater sage-grouse, a charismatic ground-dwelling bird that conservation groups have been fighting to protect for decades. The Endangered Species Act\u2013listed Lahontan cutthroat trout swims in local streams, and a rare snail, the Kings River Pyrg, has only been found in local springs. Sage grouse move through an area of wilderness near Thacker Pass.Edward Bartell Beneath the surface of Thacker Pass lies another natural resource: Millions of tons of lithium concentrated in soft, sedimentary clays. Lithium Nevada Corporation, the company behind the planned mine, believes it can generate up to 66,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium annually over the 41 years it intends to operate the mine. The company would dig the ore out of a 1,000-acre, 400-foot-deep open pit and concentrate the lithium on site in vats of sulfuric acid. This amount could go a long way toward meeting U.S. lithium demand and climate targets. In 2020, the U.S. used nearly 36,000 metric tons of lithium chemicals in batteries, according to data from consulting firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. By 2030, that figure could rise to over 300,000 metric tons, driven largely by a booming electric vehicle market. Transportation accounts for 28 percent of U.S. emissions, and automakers are in an arms race to rapidly replace gas guzzlers with lithium-powered vehicles to slash cars\u2019 climate pollution. In a carbon-free future, lithium-ion batteries will also play a key role in storing clean energy for the grid when the sun isn\u2019t shining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing. \u201cA transition to renewables, facilitated by an efficient lithium-ion battery supply-chain, provides a real opportunity to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change, which will ultimately work to protect every ecosystem on the planet,\u201d Lithium Nevada CEO Alexi Zawadzki told Grist in an email. But critics don\u2019t want to see any resource, even one so important to the green energy transition, extracted at the expense of local ecosystems. Bartell first became concerned with the mine\u2019s potential impacts during public meetings in 2019, when he learned of Lithium Nevada\u2019s plans to pump large amounts of groundwater for its operations \u2014 up to 5,200 acre-feet per year, according to the company\u2019s plan of operations (enough to fill 2,600 Olympic-sized swimming pools). This intensity of water use will draw down nearby groundwater levels, potentially drying out soils, streams, and springs. Bartell fears this will harm local fauna as well as his 51,000-acre ranching operation, which lies just northwest of the proposed mine site, mostly on land he\u2019s leased from the federal government. When Bartell brought his concerns to Lithium Nevada at a public meeting two years ago \u2014 and later in writing \u2014 he says the company downplayed how much water it would be using and shared hydrological data from its consultants that didn\u2019t match his knowledge of the region. In January 2020, around the same time that the BLM announced that it was beginning work on an environmental impact statement for the mine, Bartell hired a hydrologist to independently check Lithium Nevada\u2019s numbers. That hydrologist found numerous errors with the mining consultancy\u2019s analysis, including that it had classified creeks that run year-round as \u201cephemeral\u201d and underreported flow rates from many springs. Bartell worries that by claiming there is less water in the area than there actually is, Lithium Nevada could dry up both groundwater and streams and claim that its operations hadn\u2019t made a difference. Despite raising his concerns in writing throughout the BLM\u2019s public comment period last year, the agency incorporated the mining company\u2019s hydrology data throughout its environmental impact statement. \u201cThe BLM did very little, if any, of their own hydrology,\u201d Bartell said. \u201cThey just accepted whatever the lithium company provided.\u201d While other local stakeholders, like the nearby Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe, are still evaluating the mine\u2019s impacts and didn\u2019t raise specific concerns with Grist, Bartell isn\u2019t the only one worried. The Nevada Department of Wildlife, or NDOW, echoed many of the rancher\u2019s concerns in comments it submitted to the BLM, including that the bureau\u2019s classification of streams as ephemeral was based on \u201climited field data collection\u201d and that the methods used to determine where groundwater impacts would occur were \u201cinsufficient and lack objectivity.\u201d The NDOW also warned that noise levels from the mining operation would likely exceed standards set out in federal sage-grouse management plans, which could drive grouse away from the area. NDOW wildlife specialist Matt Maples told the BLM\u2019s district office in a January 4 letter that the mine\u2019s operations would likely disturb the area\u2019s ground and surface water, as well as vegetation found along the streams and could \u201chave permanent ramifications on the area\u2019s wildlife and habitat resources.\u201d The bureau \u201cblew off conservation community and NDOW concerns about compliance with BLM\u2019s own sage-grouse plan,\u201d said Kelly Fuller, the energy and mining campaign director at Western Watershed Project, a conservation nonprofit and a co-plaintiff on the lawsuit against the BLM that quickly followed Bartell\u2019s. Her organization submitted extensive comments to the BLM detailing other ways it believes the mine plan would violate sage-grouse protection plans, including by ignoring guidelines around buffer distances from sage-grouse mating grounds and ignoring seasonal protections. Even Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency had issues with Lithium Nevada\u2019s plan, warning the BLM that it expected \u201cadverse effects to groundwater quality,\u201d including levels of antimony, a federally designated harmful pollutant, that exceed Nevada water quality standards. Antimony, as well as arsenic, will enter the groundwater supply as Lithium Nevada backfills the mining pit with waste rock. According to the project\u2019s environmental impact statement, an antimony-rich groundwater plume is expected to extend one mile downstream from the pit for up to 300 years. Plans for mitigating antimony contamination, the EPA wrote in its formal comments to the BLM, \u201care not developed with an adequate level of detail to assess whether or how\u201d they would work. Despite all of these criticisms, the permitting process for Thacker Pass moved along swiftly. Politics seem to have played a role: Last July, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the BLM, sent a letter to Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s economic advisor, listing infrastructure, energy, and natural resources projects whose environmental impact statements were \u201cbeing expedited during the covid-19 emergency.\u201d Thacker Pass was on the list. \u201cIt absolutely was fast-tracked,\u201d Fuller said. After the BLM cleared the Thacker Pass project to move forward in January, Bartell decided to sue because he saw no other option for stopping a mine he is convinced will damage his ranching business. His February 11 complaint alleges the agency violated the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, by approving the mine based on a \u201cflawed and error-laden\u201d hydrological analysis that \u201cmasks, or will mask\u201d impacts to the Lahontan cutthroat trout and to his private lands and water rights. Also on February 11, Bartell\u2019s lawyers sent letters to the BLM, the Department of the Interior, Lithium Nevada Corporation, and its parent corporation Lithium Americas, announcing the rancher\u2019s intention to file another lawsuit in 60 days, which would be mid-April, for alleged violations to the Endangered Species Act. The lawsuit filed on February 26 by Great Basin Resource Watch, Western Watersheds Project, and other conservation groups also claims the BLM violated NEPA, as well as the bureau\u2019s own sage-grouse protection plans, scenic landscape protection requirements, and water quality standards when it approved the Thacker Pass mine. These groups, too, plan to sue over Endangered Species Act violations after a 60-day notice period. \u201cLithium Nevada has confidence in the extensive planning and baseline data collection that supports the permitting process, which was conducted over a ten-year period,\u201d Zawadzki, the Lithium Nevada CEO, told Grist. \u201cFederal regulatory agencies have conducted a thorough analysis of the information, which included public and agency comments, and developed rigorous mitigation measures prior to issuing the ROD,\u201d or record of decision, the BLM\u2019s official notice of approval. \u201cWe are committed to the responsible development of Thacker Pass through the implementation of mitigation procedures and technologies to minimize potential impacts to wildlife, flora and fauna and preserve regional biodiversity,\u201d Zawadzki went on. He also noted that Lithium Nevada has redesigned its project to avoid Lahontan cutthroat trout fisheries to the north and that it will be establishing a sagebrush habitat restoration fund in concert with the University of Nevada. Heather O\u2019Hanlon, a spokesperson for the BLM district office that approved the mine, said that the district had \u201cno comment\u201d on the criticisms raised by Bartell and others, or on the various lawsuits. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior declined to comment on the litigation, but said that President Biden has called for the agency to \u201cidentify steps to increase environmental protections and accelerate responsible development of renewable energy on public lands and waters. \u201cInterior has initiated a review of processes and procedures to date as it re-invests in a rigorous renewable energy program,\u201d the spokesperson said. While the Thacker Pass mine was reviewed and approved under the Trump Administration, another controversial lithium mine in an earlier stage of development could face closer scrutiny under Biden\u2019s Interior Department. The proposed Rhyolite Ridge mine aims to produce about 22,000 metric tons of lithium annually over 26 years on federal lands in the Silver Peak range of southern Nevada about 30 miles from the California border and due east of the Bay Area. A spokesperson for the BLM district that would oversee that mine told Grist the bureau plans to begin the project\u2019s public scoping process \u201cas early as mid-March\u201d and issue a record of decision a year later. Like Thacker Pass, the Rhyolite Ridge mine could help meet surging U.S. lithium demand. Another likeness: conservationists have grave concerns about the costs. That\u2019s because the exact spot where mining company Ioneer wants to dig is home to the entire population of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat, a rare species of wildflower. Patrick Donnelly, the Nevada state director of the Center for Biological Diversity, claims that the mine\u2019s initial exploratory activities, including grading roads and conducting small-scale excavations, have already had \u201csignificant impacts\u201d on the habitat of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat while a mysterious, possibly rodent-related catastrophe last year killed about half of the remaining plants. Many botanists believe that placing a mine at Rhyolite Ridge would be a final death knell for the species. In October 2019, Donnelly\u2019s organization petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or FWS, to emergency-list Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat under the Endangered Species Act due to the \u201cdire threat\u201d posed by mining. Last September, the Center for Biological Diversity sued FWS for \u201cslow-walking the listing process\u201d following the service\u2019s initial determination that the species deserved consideration. If successful, the lawsuit could compel FWS to make a determination immediately rather than waiting until the fall of 2021, the service\u2019s anticipated timeline for reaching a decision. Ioneer executive director James Calaway called Donnelly\u2019s allegations regarding his company\u2019s impacts on Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat \u201cabsolutely false and misleading.\u201d Calaway insisted the mining company is \u201ccompletely committed\u201d to protecting the plant and has devoted \u201cconsiderable attention and resources\u201d to studying and conserving Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat \u201cunder intense supervision by regulators.\u201d While Calaway admits that Ioneer\u2019s mine would destroy about 70 percent of the Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat population at Rhyolite Ridge, he believes the company has \u201cidentified some excellent areas to create a much larger conservation zone.\u201d But Donnelly contends that Ioneer hasn\u2019t established a viable population elsewhere or proven that it can be done. \u201cMy feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cis it\u2019s likely it\u2019s going to be the buckwheat or the mine.\u201d Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat growing in the wild.Sarah Kulpa / USFWS Still, Donnelly feels optimistic FWS will choose to list Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat as an endangered species. While that wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop the mine, he thinks that an Endangered Species Act listing alongside the Biden administration\u2019s pledge to restore more rigorous environmental review processes would make the project look \u201cmuch dicier\u201d than it did in the Trump administration\u2019s eyes. Calaway says that Ioneer will comply with all federal requirements if FWS chooses to list the species. But he believes an Endangered Species Act listing is \u201cnot helpful\u201d because the company is committed to conserving the plant. In January, Ioneer was granted a motion to intervene as a defendant in the lawsuit against FWS in order to make its case. Mining impacts aside, Calaway says that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is \u201cterribly vulnerable\u201d to climate change \u2014 a rare point of agreement between the Ioneer and its critics. \u201cWe have a climate change problem here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are determined, for the long term, to protect those plants and to uplift them. But we also think it\u2019s important for the United States to get along with its electrification objectives.\u201d The biggest action the Biden administration could do to prevent more conflicts over mining, for lithium or any other resource, is likely to not intervene in any specific project. Instead, conservation groups say there\u2019s a dire need to reform the 19th-century federal law that allows mining companies to operate on public lands in the first place. Under the 1872 Mining Law, any citizen who can demonstrate that valuable mineral deposits exist on public lands can stake a mining claim \u2014 with literal stakes \u2014 and the federal government will grant them exclusive rights to use the land for mining. \u201cThe legal view of the government is they cannot deny your valid mine claim,\u201d said Aaron Mintzes, senior policy counsel at the environmental nonprofit Earthworks. \u201cThe stake in the ground\u201d \u2014 along with some paperwork \u2014 \u201cgives you the right to mine.\u201d Critics argue that this legal position tilts the entire environmental review process in favor of mining companies. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve got the claim, the federal government says, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll review your mine, but we\u2019re going to assume you have the right to mine\u201d in this exact spot, Fuller of the Western Watershed Project said. \u201cThere\u2019s no possibility of sane siting.\u201d Mintzes said that Earthworks will be pressing the Biden administration to implement new regulations that would rein in the 1872 Mining Law, including regulations restricting the use of public lands to dump mining waste and giving land managers the explicit authority to reject mining proposals that will cause irreparable harm to wild lands. Congress could also write a new law to replace the 1872 Mining Law. While Mintzes sees that as \u201cmore of a long shot,\u201d House Natural Resources Committee Chair Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, has recently introduced a bill that would replace the current mining claim system with a leasing process more similar to what the fossil fuel industry uses. Birds take to the air near Thacker Pass.Ian Bigley / Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada /Great Basin Resource Watch Under Grijalva\u2019s bill, miners would no longer be able to stake claims, but would instead have to apply for prospecting licenses with the Interior Department. If a miner is granted a license, and if the mining company can then demonstrate that a valuable mineral deposit exists at the site, the federal government would grant it a lease. Crucially, special conservation areas and sacred sites would be off-limits \u2014 potentially heading off conflicts over threatened species like the ones around the Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge mines. What\u2019s more, miners would be required to pay a 12.5 percent royalty on new mines, the same amount oil and gas developers are required to pay. (Unlike other extractive industries, hardrock miners aren\u2019t required to pay any royalties when operating on public lands; Earthworks estimates the mining industry has extracted $300 billion worth of metals without paying the government a dime.) Fuller worries that if the Biden administration and Congress don\u2019t take steps to reform the 1872 Mining Law, the U.S. is heading into \u201cconflict after conflict for renewable energy\u2013 and electric cars\u2013related mining.\u201d Ultimately, such conflicts will only delay the transition off fossil fuels that\u2019s necessary to solve the climate crisis. There\u2019s no way around the fact that the U.S. needs lots of lithium to decarbonize its economy. Thus, according to Michael Whittaker, a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\u2019s Lithium Resource Research and Innovation Center, it\u2019s vitally important that we address the environmental issues posed by lithium mining. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of appetite right now to have a fully domestic lithium supply chain, and that\u2019s going to require these unconventional resources to get up and running quickly,\u201d Whittaker said, referring to the types of lithium deposits found in the American West. \u201cThere\u2019s really no alternative.\u201d", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Oregon": [43.938780241000075, -120.55856091199996], "Alliance": [40.921550000000025, -81.10583999999994], "March": [52.55128000000008, 0.0885000000000673], "Federal": [-30.955529999999953, -58.77953999999994], "University": [34.36515000000003, -89.53374999999994]}}, {"headline": "He brought \u2018good trouble\u2019 to environmental justice", "url": "https://grist.org/fix/cecil-corbin-mark-legacy-we-act-environmental-justice/", "image_url": "https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cecil_Corbin-Mark-e1614897420401.jpg", "text": "The Legacy of an EJ Titan Racial justice and climate justice are inseparable. Few would deny this, but that wasn\u2019t always so. For much of its history, the environmental movement has been overwhelmingly white and gave little thought to the impacts pollution and climate change had on people of color and underserved communities. The convergence of the two, which happened no more than a generation ago, came only after the tireless work of activists like Cecil Corbin-Mark. Corbin-Mark was a towering, didactic man from Harlem who always offered criticism with love. He was equally adept at organizing his neighbors as he was lobbying policymakers. Never afraid to denounce the injustice deeply entrenched in Black and brown communities, much of his life was spent tirelessly battling the colonial mindset so many live under. Growing up in a family actively engaged in the civil rights movement, it\u2019s no surprise that Corbin-Mark became one of the earliest champions of environmental justice, which was a novel, even radical, idea at the time. For three decades, he demanded justice for underserved and overlooked communities, a campaign he waged until his sudden passing last October at 51. He never stopped getting into what the late civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis would call \u201cgood, necessary trouble.\u201d Even in a year of immeasurable grief for the Black and brown communities grappling with police brutality and a disproportionate share of COVID-19 deaths, Corbin-Mark remained steadfast in the struggle to eliminate toxic pollution, address systemic racism, and implement equitable climate and energy policies. He scored a key victory, too, in helping pass landmark climate legislation that would not only commit his home state of New York to net-zero emissions by 2050, but require at least 35 percent of state energy and climate spending go to pollution-burdened communities. Corbin-Mark left a legacy that many in the movement, veterans and newcomers alike, will never forget \u2014 something three members of the House of Representatives specifically cited when they introduced a resolution honoring the activist for his life\u2019s work. As one of its first employees, Corbin-Mark helped shepherd the growth of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, which was among the earliest organizations to fight environmental racism. Its virtual memorial for Corbin-Mark drew more than 400 people, offering compelling proof of his impact. Many hailed him as a visionary and gifted policy wonk focused on making energy justice the next front in the ongoing campaign for environmental justice. Among the most lamentable things about his passing is that he didn\u2019t live to see President Biden pass a slew of executive orders centering environmental justice in his climate and economic agendas. Many of Corbin-Mark\u2019s colleagues credit him with helping carve the path that led to such a historic moment. That his life\u2019s work was inextricably tied to the rise of the movement that made it happen is not lost on those who saw him tirelessly defend marginalized communities. \u201cThe time he grew into who he became at WE ACT tracks with how the environmental justice movement has grown,\u201d says 2019 Grist 50 Fixer Kerene Tayloe, director of federal legislative affairs at WE ACT. She tears up recalling Corbin-Mark\u2019s impact on her life. \u201cHis ability to understand the importance of policy at the city level, at the state level, and at the federal level was instrumental in changing and preparing us for where we are right now. I just wish he was here to see the day [Biden\u2019s] executive orders came out.\u201d A movement takes root Corbin-Mark dedicated most of his life to serving communities of color, particularly fighting against the systemic inequities baked into the daily life of his neighborhood. The disparities are evident in even seemingly minute things: Many people in Harlem \u2014 mostly low-income people of color \u2014 must endure the pernicious summer heat of New York City, while white and wealthier residents just blocks away sit comfortably in their expensive, air-conditioned apartments. Bringing these connections to what has historically been a white-dominated movement was never an easy endeavor. About a decade after the civil rights movement in the 1960s, the first battle against environmental racism \u2014 though the term didn\u2019t exist until years later \u2014 began taking shape. State officials in North Carolina decided to dump soil laced with a carcinogen called polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) at a new hazardous waste landfill in the small, predominantly Black town of Afton. That incident gave rise to the modern environmental justice movement. Civil rights and environmental activists soon saw a pattern when a similar fight took place in New York City a few years later. City planners unilaterally decided to move a sewage treatment plant slated for an affluent neighborhood to West Harlem. Community leaders rallied opposition to the plant, which led to the creation of WE ACT for Environmental Justice in 1988. Still, the city proceeded with the plan, promising residents that the facility would be odorless and harmless. It\u2019s a classic act of environmental injustice, the sort of thing activists like Corbin-Mark fought against for decades. When residents of West Harlem started noticing a foul, noxious stench wafting as far as two miles from the plant, WE ACT and the National Resources Defense Council sued the city. The lawsuit was settled in 1993 and provided roughly $1 million in environmental benefit funds, which allowed WE ACT \u2014 an all-volunteer organization at the time \u2014 to begin paying co-founder and executive director Peggy Shepard and expand her team. Today, the org counts around 20 people in its ranks. Cecil Corbin-Mark at WE ACT\u2019s 25th anniversary event in 2013.Courtesy of WE ACT \u201cWe decided we\u2019re going to develop our own little NRDC in upper Manhattan,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cWhen we got the grant from the fund, the first staff person I thought of hiring was Cecil. We basically started the business in our new office, then hired three other people. It was just the five of us for a couple years.\u201d Vernice Miller-Travis, who cofounded WE ACT with Shepard but later moved to Washington, D.C., was impressed by Corbin-Mark, who was in his 20s at the time. \u201cI could exhale a little, knowing that there was going to be somebody at Peggy\u2019s side, building the organization and doing the work who cared about it as much as I did, and that I didn\u2019t have to be right there on the spot all the time,\u201d she says. Shepard, who lived three blocks from Corbin-Mark in West Harlem, had met him not long before. She was out and about one Saturday and stumbled upon a block party where Corbin-Mark, who worked in the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office, was telling an audience about environmental stewardship and explaining how the community could address the systemic issues entrenched in their neighborhood. \u201cI was struck by the passion and the specificity and the articulate message he was giving, so I met him and we stayed in touch,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cHis friends and family probably thought he was crazy for leaving his good city job for a startup with \u2018environmental justice\u2019 in the name.\u201d The issue of environmental racism was making its first appearance in national politics when Corbin-Mark joined WE ACT. In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order directing federal agencies to consider the environmental and health impacts of their actions on low-income communities of color. While Black environmental activists considered that groundbreaking, systemic inequities like legacy pollution persisted. Innovation with impact Corbin-Mark always had a vision coming into focus as people tossed around ideas about implementation and approach. \u201cOur action should not be without strategy,\u201d he often told colleagues (and tweeted at least once). His innovative thinking and ideas are what made him accomplish so much. An exhaustive accounting of his achievements would most likely fill a book, but those who knew him best credit him with advancing more than a dozen state legislative bills addressing toxins. He was also instrumental in getting the first line items in the New York environmental protection fund, now slated for $8 million a year. And, in the months before he died, Corbin-Mark championed several clean-energy programs and initiatives that WE ACT plans to continue pursuing. Beyond his strong relationships with several state officials, Corbin-Mark regularly forged international relationships while attending climate and environmental events from Brazil to South Africa to Indonesia. Even those who felt challenged by Corbin-Mark\u2019s positions and disagreed with his views admired his passion and mourned his passing. George Floyd\u2019s killing last summer prompted Corbin-Mark to once again focus most of his energy on highlighting the connections between racial justice and environmental justice. \u201cWe have to remember that Cecil was a Black man,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cAt the large white organizations, the higher spots don\u2019t generally go to people of color.\u201d The National Black Environmental Justice Network, for which Corbin-Mark served on the steering committee, was resurrected after a 15-month hiatus. Floyd\u2019s final words \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2014 became a rallying cry for racial justice, a sentiment shared by anyone who\u2019s been subjected to environmental racism. After all, African Americans are 79 percent more likely to live in neighborhoods with severe industrial pollution. Corbin-Mark, Shepard, and other Black environmental justice pioneers long challenged the \u201cwhite savior\u201d narrative of the historically, and overwhelmingly, white environmental movement. Raya Salter, policy organizer for the New York Renews coalition that helped pass New York\u2019s groundbreaking climate legislation, said Corbin-Mark\u2019s upbringing in Harlem \u2014 a community dubbed the heartbeat of the Black story in America \u2014 and his role in the environmental justice space are in many ways similar to the Harlem Renaissance. \u201cHe was kind of the James Baldwin of the environmental justice movement, because no matter what or who he encountered, he just always showed dignity and intelligence,\u201d says Salter. Even Beverly Wright, founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice who has, with Shepard, been called the \u201cmother of environmental justice,\u201d echoed the idea when she repeatedly called Corbin-Mark a \u201crenaissance man\u201d during his memorial. He was the James Baldwin of the environmental justice movement. Whatever he encountered, he always showed dignity and intelligence. Raya Salter Yet even as the movement he led moved into the mainstream, Corbin-Mark was, as always, looking ahead to the next challenge. He had begun building an \u201cenergy justice\u201d movement just before his passing. A growing body of evidence shows that racial covenants and racist city planning policies during the Jim Crow era determined which communities lived near landfills, sewage treatment plants, refineries, and other sources of industrial pollution. If clean energy is to take over the grid, Corbin-Mark questioned whether historically underserved communities would benefit. His foresight was critical when it came to energy initiatives. A 2017 report by the NAACP outlined how governments should start considering access to energy services a basic human right. Among families living below the poverty level, Black households are more than twice as likely to experience power shut-offs than white ones. This is especially true in New York, where Corbin-Mark started a solar-installation program that would benefit underserved communities, working alongside agencies like city utility Con Edison and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. \u201cCecil knew how politics got done and how policies could change,\u201d said Stephan Roundtree, the northeast director at the nonprofit Vote Solar and one of many people Corbin-Mark mentored over the years. \u201cBut he was really serious about starting with what people were telling us about their lives, because he knows that\u2019s where a just policy comes from \u2014 by really addressing the lived conditions of people on the ground.\u201d While punctuality was never Corbin-Mark\u2019s strongest suit, he made a lasting impact wherever he went. To people who knew him, it seemed he was always clutching a book in one hand and his phone and keys in the other while walking to the subway station or striding toward a rental car when traveling. Details like that may seem small, even inconsequential, when looking back on the life of a pioneer like Corbin-Mark, but they further humanize a man whose life, actions, and words will serve as a reminder of the political will needed to address institutional racism and inequities woven into the fabric of this nation. \u201cIn a social movement, we build things, we organize, we do policy and advocacy, but not everyone was a visionary,\u201d Miller-Travis said. \u201cCecil was that kind of person, and we are going to miss him terribly.\u201d", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"New York": [40.71455000000003, -74.00713999999994], "Clinton": [38.76156000000003, -76.91459999999995], "Wright": [30.45485000000008, -86.63837999999998], "Manhattan": [40.714500000000044, -74.00600999999995], "Washington": [38.890370000000075, -77.03195999999997]}}, {"headline": "Government has no climate change plan - MPs", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56285239", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10817/production/_116870676_porttalbotsteelworks.jpg", "text": "The report notes that the government intends to publish what the MPs call a \"plethora\" of strategies setting out how it will reduce emissions in sectors ranging from transport to heating buildings.

Now he says the technology derived from those early efforts will make it possible to produce plastic almost exclusively from recycled materials. \u201cWe\u2019re consuming more and more plastics,\u201d says the Quebec-based engineer and founder of Pyrowave, a company pioneering microwave-based plastic recycling technology. \u201cYet there are not that many solutions to address the end-of-life problem, and this is what we\u2019re proposing.\u201d Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy The technology is so promising it has caught the attention of French tire giant Michelin. Last year, the company announced a partnership with Pyrowave to build a microwave recycling system for tires. It will be the first time Doucet\u2019s technology is used on a commercial scale. Most recycling in Canada today is mechanical, where plastics are shredded before being melted down to make new, usually lower-quality, products. For the process to be viable, the stream of plastics entering the processing facility needs to be clean and well sorted, which poses huge logistical challenges. Pyrowave\u2019s technology then uses high-powered microwaves to break clean polystyrene \u2014 a common plastic used to make everything from yogurt cups to keyboards \u2014 into molecular components, or monomers, that manufacturers can use to create entirely new polystyrene plastic. Simple as it sounds, the approach is novel. Few researchers had successfully used microwaves to break plastic into its constituent parts until Doucet, who has a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, took up the challenge with a team in 2009. At the time, he was working on food waste technologies and wanted a new challenge. \u201cWe started getting approached for plastic waste,\u201d he says. Plastic recycling was something new. He wondered if pyrolysis could be used in the recycling process. Pyrolysis is a chemical process that burns carbon-based materials like wood or plastic without oxygen to remove the material\u2019s hydrogen and oxygen molecules, leaving nothing but carbon. It\u2019s ancient \u2014 Egyptians used pyrolysis to make charcoal. Doucet thought a modified version could be used to recycle plastic. \u201cVery quickly, we fell on a microwave unit in the lab and started playing with microwaves,\u201d he said. They found high-powered microwaves worked \u2014 an exciting discovery for the environmentally minded team. \u201cPyrowave\u2019s technology might play a role in terms of displacing the production of virgin plastic and materials, but until we have more transparent and verifiable data on the yields, environmental and climate impact, we need a cautionary approach,\u201d says Shanar Tabrizi, chemical recycling and plastics-to-fuel policy officer for Zero Waste Europe. wingedwolf / Getty Images Those potential impacts are broad, from the energy required to collect, sort, and clean plastic waste before the recycling process to managing the toxic residues created by plastic additives. She also noted life-cycle assessments can be misleading, depending on their methodologies. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to assess (Pyrowave\u2019s) claims and see whether there might be significant pollutants released in the process,\u201d says Richard Heinberg, senior fellow at the Post Carbon Institute. \u201cIn general, anything we can do to recycle plastic in more environmentally friendly ways helps, but reducing the scale of production and consumption is even better.\u201d Maximizing the environmental potential of Doucet\u2019s technology demands a wholesale restructuring of how we produce and dispose of plastics, the Quebec researcher said. New facilities that use microwave pyrolysis to manufacture plastic will need to be built. And as long as the price of virgin-oil plastic remains low, recycled plastic can\u2019t compete. It will take government regulations mandating that new plastic products contain mostly recycled materials to make the switch, Doucet said. He compared microwave pyrolysis recycling and virgin-oil plastic manufacturing to the difference between steam and electric trains. As electricity became widespread, train engineers quickly realized it was more efficient to build entire rail systems based on high-speed electric trains than it was to replace coal with electric heating coils in steam train boilers. The new technology pushed a wholesale shift in how rail systems worked. \u201cThis is the opportunity to completely rethink,\u201d Doucet says. The petrochemical and oil and gas industries so far show no signs of slowing down. Virgin-oil plastic factories have been integrated into oil and gas infrastructure like refineries and pipelines for decades \u2014 investments that industry is loath to abandon. The sector is betting on continued plastic production to stay afloat as the world transitions away from fossil fuels, with plastic manufacturing anticipated to fuel between 45 percent and 95 percent of the sector\u2019s future growth. Fossil fuel and petrochemical companies are even spending $509 billion more worldwide to expand their facilities by 2024, according to a September 2020 report by the Carbon Tracker Initiative. Rosemary Calvert / Getty Images That has environmentalists concerned. While recycling \u2014 including microwave pyrolysis recycling \u2014 can be part of the solution, it can\u2019t be used to justify current levels of production and plastic use, said Laura Yates, lead plastics campaigner at Greenpeace Canada. The organization has been leading efforts for greater government regulations to decrease overall plastic production and implement stringent recycling requirements in Canada. In particular, Yates is concerned about efforts by the plastics industry to convert plastic waste into vehicle fuel. That will continue to stimulate virgin-oil plastic production and fail to reduce overall GHG emissions, Yates said. Still, there are glimmers of hope. Virgin-oil plastic production decreased by four percent in 2020, and the trend is expected to continue in the coming decades, according to the Carbon Tracker Initiative. That shift is driven by more stringent rules in China and Europe mandating that plastic products be made primarily from recycled materials. They have also started to make recycled plastic economically competitive in those markets, Doucet said. As well as the shift in Europe, the federal government is currently drafting new plastics regulations that could see similar policies implemented here, despite intense pushback from the plastics industry on key parts of the planned regulations. Doucet is hopeful that if the new rules are implemented, they will help make plastic recycling \u2014 including microwave pyrolysis recycling \u2014 commercially viable in Canada. Doucet is honest about his technology\u2019s limitations. It is only one tool to end the plastic crisis, not a panacea. Reducing how much plastic we use and ensuring what gets produced gets recycled more efficiently remain essential.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Most": [50.51479000000006, 13.637870000000078]}}, {"headline": "Yes, alt seafood is good for the planet.

In the 1970s, the burgeoning natural-foods movement embraced carob as a \u201chealthy\u201d alternative to chocolate. The chalky, cloying substance went on to rob countless children of their childhoods. It eventually fell out of favor, mostly because it was universally loathed, but there\u2019s a lesson here for anyone trying to create delicious ersatz products: It must approach the taste and texture of the original. Most players in today\u2019s alt-protein sector have internalized this point. Plant-based burgers and sausages are highly evolved replacements capable of fooling even the most discerning palates, and the number of entrants in the market grows daily. But seafood has lagged behind faux beef and chicken for a few reasons. For one, it is already considered a healthy alternative to meat, especially fish like salmon and tuna that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. \u201cDHA omega-3 is important for our brain, eye, and heart health,\u201d says nutritionist Frances Largeman-Roth. \u201cMost of us, especially vegans, are really challenged to get what they need.\u201d What\u2019s more, replicating something like a tuna steak or sushi-grade salmon is considerably harder than a ground meat analogue like a burger or sausage. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy Yet the environmental stakes are just as high when it comes to seafood. While our love for red meat is devastating the planet and exacerbating climate change, overfishing and destructive techniques like trawling have destabilized ocean ecosystems. Over 90 percent of wild fisheries are considered overfished or at maximum capacity. Shrimp is by far the most popular seafood in the U.S., and mangrove forests, which absorb carbon dioxide and help protect coastlines, are being cleared to make way for massive shrimp farms. I\u2019ve flirted with the idea of veganism, having recently written a few articles on the subject of alt-meats and interviewed the cofounders of a seaweed protein start-up as well as a vegan astrophysicist-turned-food scientist. I\u2019m also intrigued by some newcomers to the marketplace \u2014 plant-based crab cakes! Vegan shrimp! Fishless fillets! Even a bluefin(less) tuna! \u2014 produced by tech companies attracting VC support and consumers seeking more responsible culinary choices. But enough about all this. Are these products any good? Would it be possible to feed my family these meat-free seafood analogues for an entire week? Could I expiate guilt while shoring up our Omega-3s? I decided to give it a shot. Monday: Vegan Shrimp Scampi My experiment with plant-based seafood began at Orchard Grocer, a vegan grocery and sandwich shop on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. The neighborhood is steeped in immigrant history and no small amount of irony: Old-school delis peddling smoked fish and kosher meats have been edged out by hip vegan restaurants. These hotspots peddle similar fare, but instead of standard dishes prepared from animal flesh, everything is made with plant proteins and mysterious ingredients like konjac and algal oil. With this in mind, I decided to pick up a couple of alt-meat sandwiches to see if the Poppy (chickpea \u201ctuna\u201d salad with the works, on marble rye) or the Marlowe (a Reuben made with beet-brined Blackbird seitan and Violife provolone) could pass for the real thing. As I would discover later, these items taken out of the box or pouch might\u2019ve given me pause, but when prepared by an expert they were surprisingly good. My carnivorous husband went so far as to call the Marlowe delicious with the texture of corned beef, and my Poppy was surprisingly tunalike, with a faint umami flavor complemented by a nice, chewy texture. I ordered a side of carrot lox as well, and after my initial reaction \u2014 it\u2019s just carrot! It\u2019s bullshit! \u2014 a pleasant smokiness lingered. I was excited to kick off faux seafood week with vegan shrimp, because not only is the crustacean my 6-year-old\u2019s all-time favorite food, my husband is allergic to it. It also is among the most ethically dubious things you can eat in terms of environmental destruction and human rights abuses. Scampi is easy and usually a crowd-pleaser, so I set a pot of water to boil for the pasta and opened a package of vegan shrimp. These facsimiles, made with modified starch, pea protein, and glucomannan (a dietary fiber derived from the konjac root), had an oddly rough texture and resembled nothing so much as a baker\u2019s dozen of severed fingers. Uncooked shrimp are dull gray in color \u2014 only when heated do they perk up and turn pink, curling as they cook. These vegan shrimp came pink and stayed pink. They\u2019re also curled straight out of the bag. Without these visual cues, I had no idea how long to cook them. I saut\u00e9ed them for a few minutes, adding ample amounts of garlic and lemon. I found them edible and somewhat shrimpy in flavor, but their gummy worm-like texture, which slowly calcified through dinner, had an unsettling uniformity to it. Pink is the new gray: Konjac root gives these counterfeit crustaceans a chewy, almost shrimplike texture.Adrienne Day Texture is critical when creating plant-based seafoods and the hardest thing to get right, says food biotechnologist Sonia Hurtado, cofounder and chief science officer at Kuleana, which has a bluefin tuna analogue in the pipeline. \u201cIf you want to do a cooked fish like cod, you can do it with current processing technologies, but you can\u2019t do that when you want to mimic raw flesh\u201d for something like tuna or salmon sashimi. Hurtado wouldn\u2019t tell me how Kuleana approximates the texture of raw fish beyond saying \u201cenzymes and algae\u201d play into it, but she says it works. \u201cWhen we did blind taste tests, people thought our product was real bluefin tuna,\u201d she says. Kuleana plans on launching their product this year, starting with restaurants and then moving into retail stores. Tuesday: Fish and Chips While plant-based nigiri might turn off sushi fans, there is a growing appetite for faux fish. That might explain why Gardein\u2019s fishless filets are seemingly ubiquitous, at least in Brooklyn \u2014 even my local deli carries them. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest seller in the U.S. by far,\u201d says Jennifer Lamy, senior manager of the sustainable seafood initiative at the Good Food Institute. Granted that has more to do with the lack of competition than anything else. But that, too, is changing: Sophie\u2019s Kitchen recently struck a deal with Walmart to carry its faux crab cakes and scallops. Even a giant brand like Nestl\u00e9 is casting its line, test-marketing its fish-free Vuna in Switzerland. The goal of the alt-meat sector is to reach a flexitarian audience \u2014 the vegan-curious, if you will \u2014 and convince people that their products excel on moral, environmental, and health grounds, and can compete, cheek by jowl, with equally delicious animal proteins. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate how important it is that these products taste good,\u201d Lamy says. Monica Talbert knows how critical that is. In 2013, she and her sister teamed up with their mother to found Van Cleve Seafood, which developed the Chesapeake blue crab pie endorsed by the likes of Oprah. But Talbert saw firsthand the human and environmental cost of the seafood industry, and in May 2020 she founded The Plant Based Seafood Co. One of its first products was a faux crab cake so authentic that people called it the best crab cake they\u2019ve ever had, she says. Her phone started ringing with queries from around the world. \u201cIt was then that I saw the potential opportunity and the potential impact of plant-based seafood,\u201d says Talbert. Baked and served with french fries and a dollop of ketchup, Gardein\u2019s filets made for a more than passable fish-and-chips dinner. It tasted much like your standard fish fillet, though the Gardein \u201cfish\u201d filling had a spongy rather than flaky quality. That didn\u2019t stop us from quickly polishing it off, though. Wednesday: Vegan Smoked Lox and Cavi-art The idea of caviar without the fish eggs becomes much more palatable when you check the price of the real stuff. A 100-gram jar of Russ & Daughters\u2019 Osetra Gueldenstaedtii caviar will set you back about $500. The same amount will buy 72 jars of Cavi-art, available in both black (the \u201cfancy\u201d stuff) and orange roe, the kind you often find in sushi rolls. A purist certainly won\u2019t be satisfied with the fake stuff, but the fact that roe-producing sturgeon are teetering on the brink of extinction might soon leave them with few other options. I\u2019m hardly a purist, as my experience with caviar is limited, but I found these seaweed-based analogues impressively realistic, with the tensile quality of caviar. They left a pleasing salty-umami aftertaste, though they didn\u2019t burst open and melt in the mouth quite the same way. I wasn\u2019t sure how to serve them \u2014 I was running low on blini and Dom Perignon \u2014so I included them on a bagel platter with Sophie\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s vegan smoked salmon and other fixings. The vegan alternative to brined salmon had a strange rubbery quality and came out of the package soaking wet \u2014 I literally had to wring it out over the sink. And the taste didn\u2019t fool anyone. My husband took one bite and gave the rest to the cat, who didn\u2019t seem interested in it, either. It had a decently smoky flavor though, and when I sandwiched it in a bagel with the works, I was able to more or less pretend it was the real deal. Thursday: Fish-Free Tuna Blind Taste Test So far, I have to say, I was impressed by the vegan seafood I\u2019d tried. That ended with faux tuna. I really wanted to like it, especially since Good Catch seems like a company in it for the right reasons. It also is aiming for something that competes nutritionally with heart-healthy fish. \u201cThey do this by adding algal oil to their protein base, which is made from various plant proteins,\u201d Largeman-Roth says. Algal oil, which is derived from certain marine algae, is an excellent source of DHA omega-3. \u201cIt also gives the product a \u2018from the sea\u2019 flavor, which may or may not be to your liking,\u201d she says. I cut open a pouch of Good Catch \u201cnaked\u201d fish-free tuna and hoo-boy, did I take an instant dislike to it! I can\u2019t tell you if it was the algal oil, the product\u2019s brownish hue, or its musky odor, but neither mayo nor dill nor salt and pepper, lemon, or even sriracha could disguise its flaccid, almost-tuna qualities. A blind taste test with Bumble Bee tuna fooled no one, though my husband proclaimed the fish-free tuna \u201cgood,\u201d albeit slightly grittier than tuna \u2014 but he also eats tinned sardines (topped with yogurt!) for lunch. This brings me to another issue facing some of these vegan seafoods: the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d problem. How much should they resemble the real deal? When biting into a steak, you encounter buttery flesh, but also fat, gristle, and bone. Is this what we crave? Is a desire to strip flesh from bone while spitting out gristle somehow encoded in our DNA? Friday: Good Catch Crabless Cakes For the final evening of my experiment, I pan-fried Good Catch crabless crab cakes and paired them with homemade remoulade. I served them to friends, who happen to be seafood lovers, in our corona-pod and the cakes were gone within minutes. Everyone agreed they tasted just like crab, but I have to wonder if the other flavors in the mix \u2014 the breadcrumb coating, a squeeze of lemon, a dusting of parsley \u2014 fooled our brains into thinking we were eating genuine crab, not \u201ca six-plant protein blend.\u201d But with our bellies full, wine glasses low, and appetites satiated, it didn\u2019t seem to matter.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Chesapeake": [36.71428000000003, -76.24778999999995], "Brooklyn": [40.692450000000065, -73.99035999999995], "Roth": [49.24681000000004, 11.090850000000046], "Manhattan": [40.714500000000044, -74.00600999999995], "Most": [50.51479000000006, 13.637870000000078]}}, {"headline": "Philippines reef littered with PPE face masks", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-56322369", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p09942dx.jpg", "text": "Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is washing up on coral reefs close to the Philippine capital, Manila.

Charging consumers the full life-cycle cost, including the cost of disposal, of what they buy seems easy. Would it work? \u2014 Not Only Wise, Also Saves Tons of Emissions A. Dear NO WASTE, There\u2019s been a recent surge in the social awareness of waste. Even since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many stores are reporting an uptick in interest in sustainability and no/low-waste products. Climate-conscious consumers are channeling their single-use guilt into enthusiasm for brands with limited packaging, recycled jeans, and reusable food wrappers. And, one might reason, what better way of educating shoppers about the environmental impacts of their purchases than having the full life-cycle climate cost reflected in the price tag? Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy In a way, that idea reflects something called the \u201cpolluter pays principle.\u201d It\u2019s a concept that comes up in international climate negotiations to explain why companies from wealthy, industrialized countries should give money to developing nations to help offset the environmental damage inflicted in the process of building said wealth. It\u2019s more or less what it sounds like: Whoever made the mess \u2014 be it carbon emissions or chemical runoff or a gazillion microplastics \u2014 should pay to clean it up in the end. But polluting companies aren\u2019t engaging in mischief entirely for their own benefit. If you buy something from one of these polluting entities or use their services in some way, you arguably bear some responsibility for the mess resulting from your purchase\u2019s creation and disposal. But is it really fair to suggest that consumers are just as much to blame for the environmental hazards of the industrial process as the producers? I think not. Consumer demand isn\u2019t completely inconsequential, nor is it the driving force behind all industry decisions. The reality of modern markets and consumption is far more complex than that. Sure, people want and need to buy things to feed or clothe or otherwise take care of themselves, but businesses also have hidden ways of selling you as many of those things as humanly possible. It\u2019s hardly your fault, for example, that the little recycling symbol means next to nothing. Or that the expensive cell phone you tell yourself you\u2019ll use for the next decade was actually built to fail after three years. I think you\u2019re suggesting that if consumers had to pay for the full disposal process of all that they buy, they\u2019d buy far fewer unnecessary items. Businesses would then be forced to produce far fewer items, and we\u2019d end up with less waste. I definitely see how this could be advantageous for things like electronics, which produce very expensive and hard-to-deal-with waste, and how it might be a way to curb the whole practice of planned obsolescence. (Note that France recently dealt with this problem by requiring companies to let consumers know how easy certain electronic products are to repair, instead of making those products more expensive.) However, in practice, there are many disadvantages to this full carbon footprint strategy of pricing. In fact, it raises a lot of the same issues of the old \u201cindividual climate responsibility\u201d versus \u201csystemic change\u201d debate (that old chestnut!). Even if large companies and governments \u2014 the ones with the real power to institute systemic change \u2014 have made terrible decisions in the past with regard to climate change, what good is it for individuals to pay the price? Of course, individuals have benefited from those government or corporate decisions because we pay an artificially low price for things like food, clothing, and energy. There are reasons that \u201csustainably made\u201d jeans cost $200. Perhaps the denim is made from regeneratively farmed cotton in a fair-wage factory that uses nontoxic dyes and offsets its water usage. It takes a lot of money to clean up your manufacturing process and compensate your employees well! But the reality is that not every consumer can afford to make the most climate-friendly purchase. Adding on the eventual cost of recycling that fabric or offsetting the carbon emissions the cotton will release in a landfill just feels excessive! If we propose that everyone pay the real cost \u2014 one that takes into account all the pollution that any single item produces \u2014 of everything they consume, we might be forgetting that there are many millions of Americans who can barely afford even those falsely cheap necessities. The idea of adding the cost of disposal to the price of any item is basically instituting a sort of sales tax, and as we already know, that\u2019s a highly regressive form of tax because it disproportionately burdens people with lower incomes. Why? Because everyone needs to buy basic things like food and clothing, but they make up a far larger proportion of a poor household\u2019s spending than a wealthy one\u2019s. It just doesn\u2019t seem right that someone who makes $20,000 a year pays the same amount of tax on a cell phone as someone who makes $200,000 a year. By the same token, it\u2019s not really fair for that person making $20,000 to suddenly have to pay, say, 30 percent more for that cell phone, even if that reflects the true cost of its disposal. In my opinion, the easiest solution to the myriad \u201cwho\u2019s picking up this check?\u201d type problems associated with environmental and climate responsibility is to let governments take care of it, rather than foisting additional burdens onto households. And here\u2019s the thing: You do already help pay for the government to dispose of your waste \u2014 in the form of taxes, garbage bills, and in some municipalities, like Seattle, a whole extra utility charge. Granted, there is at least one intriguing international example of the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d doctrine. Switzerland is considered to be something of a marvel in terms of how much of its waste is recycled. That\u2019s often attributed to the fact that both businesses and individuals are considered \u201cpolluters\u201d and charged for the disposal of waste. For example, trash bags are heavily taxed, giving Swiss consumers an incentive to alter their consumption habits to produce less trash. They even have actual trash police to enforce proper recycling practices! But we\u2019re back to the equity issue. Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and more importantly, it has a heftier social welfare system than the United States. If by some political miracle you were able to pass the sort of planet-focused pricing system you suggest and suddenly everything you could possibly buy was significantly more expensive than it was yesterday, there would be riots in the streets! Have you ever seen the strength of opposition to a ballot initiative that would result in a 0.1 percent tax increase? In the end, making things more expensive is never, ever going to be the best way to get people on board with more environmentally sound practices. Any really sustainable climate future is going to have to be built on more constructive policies than punitive ones. Analytically, Umbra Grist's comments only work with JavaScript.

Mostly white men. If you watched news about climate change on TV last year, chances are you saw a white man on-screen. According to an analysis published this week by Media Matters For America, a nonprofit media watchdog, people of color made up just 8 percent of guests interviewed or featured in the major broadcast networks\u2019 climate coverage in 2020 \u2014 we\u2019re looking at you, ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox Broadcasting Company. Women were also less likely to be in front of the camera, comprising 28 percent of guests. The total amount of time that these broadcast networks spent on the climate crisis was down 53 percent compared to 2019. Climate-related segments claimed 112 minutes of airtime over the course of the year, less than your average movie. That\u2019s not because there weren\u2019t worthy stories \u2014 wildfires blazed, the Arctic lost historic amounts of ice, and 2020 was tied for the warmest year on record \u2014 but likely because the pandemic consumed our lives. The study found that broadcast coverage rarely mentioned the connections between coronavirus and climate change, such as how both disasters disproportionately impact people of color and lower-income communities. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy The underwhelming representation of people of color isn\u2019t new. 2020 marks the fourth consecutive year \u2014 as long as Media Matters has been tracking the numbers \u2014 that less than 10 percent of network television\u2019s climate guests were people of color. Only six women of color were featured out of the total 89 guests the report identified. Why, then, have people of color and women repeatedly been underrepresented in broadcast television? Allison Fisher, the director of Media Matters\u2019 climate and energy program, suggested that television news outlets often don\u2019t make the effort to speak to frontline communities, relying on climate scientists and politicians instead. In 2020, a presidential election year, politicians were the most common guests for climate change segments. While climate activists were more commonly featured in prior years, broadcast TV only featured one activist guest this past year \u2014 Greta Thunberg, the small but mighty Swedish activist. While traditional experts like scientists and politicians are crucial, Fisher said, they should be featured in tandem with others. \u201cPeople experiencing climate change are experts,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThey\u2019re the pioneers of what climate impact is and looks like, and how to live with it and adapt to it. I think we have to redefine the way we\u2019re talking about expertise in this particular issue.\u201d The problem runs deeper than television \u2014 it\u2019s partly a reflection of diversity issues in climate science, advocacy, journalism, and politics. Although numbers have ticked up in recent years, people of color still make up a very small percentage, sometimes less than 10 percent, of top environmental groups\u2019 staff, according to Green 2.0, a nonprofit watchdog. If the people leading the most well-known organizations are consistently white men, Fisher said, they\u2019re going to be the ones featured on television. It\u2019s time for broadcast television companies to face this data and address it, Fisher said. \u201cThis is a story that we\u2019ve told year after year after year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a known problem for a while.

This high-intensity light probe can identify rocks at a distance. It's a technique that was also employed by Nasa's previous rover, Curiosity. But Perseverance has some enhancements, including a microphone that allows us to actually hear the laser at work. This isn't just some nice-to-have feature, a gimmick for PR purposes, but provides extra information that is useful to scientists. The sound of the laser hitting rocks reveals knowledge such as the hardness of the targets being investigated. \"If we tap on a surface that is hard, we will not hear the same sound as when we fire on a surface that is soft,\" explained Naomi Murdoch, from the National Higher French Institute of Aeronautics and Space, in Toulouse. \"Take for example chalk and marble. These two materials have an identical chemical composition (calcium carbonate), but very different physical properties.\" In a media briefing on Wednesday, Dr Murdoch played three different sounds recorded by the SuperCam microphone. One was of the general sound of Mars, the second was of some wind gusts, and the third was the staccato pops from the laser in action. Perseverance landed in Mars' Jezero Crater on 18 February to search for evidence of past life. The deep bowl is regarded as an excellent location for such a quest because it almost certainly held a lake billions of years ago; and where there's been water, perhaps there's been life, too. The SuperCam instrument was developed in a partnership between French and American research teams. Its first rock target selected for study was dubbed \"M\u00e1az\", which means Mars in the Navajo language spoken by Native Americans in the southwestern United States.

This ability to clone itself means it can live an extremely long time. image copyrightSHANE GROSS image captionSeagrasses are plants with amazing abilities to soak up carbon \"It's a remarkable plant not only in the capacity to sequester carbon, but also because it's one of the longest-lived organisms on the planet,\" said Prof Duarte. \"In the marine protected areas of Ibiza we documented one clone where we estimated that the seed that produced that clone was released into the seafloor and sprouted 200,000 years ago.\" \"A clone could be eternal, kind of,\" says Dr N\u00faria Marb\u00e0, from the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Mallorca. \"If there are no damages that disturb it, it could last for forever - well maybe not forever but for an incredibly long time.\" But despite its ability to live almost infinitely, Posidonia is finding the modern world increasingly treacherous. This vivid green carpet that extends under the seas in the Balearics faces an ongoing threat from boats dropping their anchors which crush, tear and destroy the meadows. One study showed that between 2008 and 2012, Posidonia meadows in Formentera were reduced by 44% because of the impact of anchoring. image copyrightSHANE GROSS image captionOxygen bubbles on a seagrass plant The plant also grows extremely slowly. The damage caused by one yacht's anchor in a single day several years ago would take almost 1,000 years to restore. Another threat comes from too many nutrients in the waters, caused by effluent released from water treatment sites across the islands. But perhaps the biggest and most difficult challenge for Posidonia is climate change. \"Posidonia has an upper thermal limit of about 28C,\" says Dr Marb\u00e0. \"I think it's about half of the summers since 2000 that we have exceeded this temperature in the water in the Balearic Islands. \"It doesn't cause massive mortality. But it's excessive for the slow growth of the plant.\" image copyrightDBCA image captionSeagrass meadows off the coast of Western Australia So what can be done to help protect this amazingly powerful seagrass? Government action to protect Posidonia in the Balearics has been ramped up in recent years and public awareness of the importance of the species is rising. But some researchers believe that putting a financial value on the carbon that's locked up by Posidonia could release the funds to save it. \"As countries try and reach the goals of the Paris agreement, the forecast is that carbon credits are going to see a tenfold increase in value,\" said Prof Carlos Duarte. \"Therefore, there's likely to be an increase in investment in habitats like Posidonia that can lock up carbon and generate these credits.\" This would be welcome news in Ibiza and Formentera. If the carbon that's already been sequestered by the seagrass increases in value, then it will pay to protect and even attempt to restore the Posidonia meadows. But time and rising temperatures are the key challenge, as Dr N\u00faria Marb\u00e0 explains. \"The whole thing of planting seagrasses is that you have to do a massive effort at the beginning to start the process. And then you just wait for the plant itself to grow. \"If we are in a hurry, at human timescales, it's impossible. \"But if we don't mind, and we can wait for a few centuries, it will be okay.\"", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Ibiza": [38.90625000000006, 1.4195400000000404], "Duarte": [34.13961000000006, -117.97049999999996], "Paris": [48.85717000000005, 2.3414000000000215]}}, {"headline": "Want a fairer, more sustainable world?

Maeve is a comic, writer, and co-host of the Mothers of Invention podcast. Thanu is an activist, DJ, and U.S. communications director at 350.org. Their whole conversation is fire \u2014 and one we highly recommend watching \u2014 but we\u2019ve pulled together a few highlights here for your reading pleasure. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy On their chosen art forms Thanu: For me, DJ-ing is very much about joy. It\u2019s about creating spaces to envision the world we want to see. Ten years ago, when I started in the immigrant rights movement, I often found that it was intense, policy-oriented work. That\u2019s true of a lot of the social justice work that I do. We don\u2019t always think, \u201cOK, what are we fighting for?\u201d When I DJ, I curate spaces particularly for queer folks, for people of color, for immigrants to connect. It\u2019s about building the world we\u2019re fighting for \u2014 I feel an arts practice helps to do that. And I love comedy! I would love to know, for you, what that has to do with climate. Maeve: That\u2019s so funny, because that is what happened \u2014 what you mentioned about joy and levity being a crucial part of what a future would look like. I write about immigration, too, and I\u2019m an immigrant myself. Moving to the U.S. as a white person from Europe really got me curious about other people\u2019s experience, particularly if they\u2019re not white and European. I think a lot of migration stories and climate stories are told like, \u201cHere\u2019s a victim, here\u2019s a person whose life is made up of sadness and tragedy,\u201d and that\u2019s dehumanizing. Humor is a way of returning what\u2019s already in people\u2019s lives. No matter how dark things get, you\u2019re going to giggle at a funeral. Your humanity is going to bubble up in some way. On the right to migrate Thanu: There\u2019s a lot of updating that needs to happen to global immigration policy. When thinking about external migration, we have to think about the role of the United States, of Canada, of Europe, in creating this climate crisis. All of the most polluting industries are from the West. We have to connect climate to imperialism and colonialism, and to the right of communities from the Global South to be able to migrate for their safety and their prosperity. Maeve: I really connect with that. Talking about this and explaining it to people is valuable work, and I love how you do that. I worry about the message that climate is a threat to national security. I don\u2019t agree with that messaging, because it\u2019s fear-based. What\u2019s a good way to discuss this, and make it known? Thanu: That framing is super dangerous. I actually think we have to be careful when people say governments should call a climate emergency \u2014 I\u2019m like, \u201cHold up. Let\u2019s actually think about what a national emergency entails. In a national emergency, borders are shut down and communities are oppressed.\u201d Maeve: That\u2019s exactly how Trump created the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program. Thanu: Exactly. When it\u2019s put in a national security frame, it\u2019s actually super racist. It stops Black and brown communities from being able to cross borders. I think it\u2019s important not to use the trope of \u201cWe have to do something about climate, because otherwise a billion people are going to migrate.\u201d From my perspective, migration is a human right. We need to focus on the industries that have caused the climate crisis, not the vulnerable communities that are moving. On International Women\u2019s Day Maeve: We know that the people who are affected first and worst by climate chaos are women. There\u2019s a balance here, where you don\u2019t want to be too prescriptive, especially with language, but you also want to point out that this is really important. On our podcast, Mothers of Invention, we honor the fact that women and femme people are so often the ones coming up with solutions in their communities and outside of their communities. That was kind of an exciting revelation for me, to be honest. Thanu: That\u2019s exactly right. When we think about the climate crisis, it\u2019s often women who are also holding down the family dynamics, ensuring that their families and communities have food. And when you think about the places most impacted by the climate crisis, whether it\u2019s parts of Africa or South Asia or the Pacific islands, it\u2019s often women and femmes that are trying to figure out how we move from crisis and chaos to resilience and mitigation. And that\u2019s what I love about your podcast, how y\u2019all really center those solutions. Maeve: There\u2019s another podcast I\u2019ve been listening to called Hot Take \u2014 it both enrages and energizes me. One of the hosts is a hardcore investigative journalist, Amy Westervelt, who\u2019s been writing on climate for years and really has got the goods. The other host, Mary Heglar, is an absolutely gorgeous writer. Their podcast is giving me life at the moment. Do you have heroic femmes and women doing work in this space that you\u2019d like to shout out? Thanu: My friend C\u00e9line Semaan from The Slow Factory talks a lot about climate and fashion. And a lot of the climate youth, like Xiye Bastida and Helena Gualinga and Jamie Margolin \u2014 there are so many amazing women, femmes, queer folks who are thinking about climate and its intersections. Young people really give me energy. I think they understand the connections here, and also are able to root things in joy. I don\u2019t do climate work out of fear. I totally recognize that people are fearful. But I think that this year has reinforced to me why we need compassion and kindness and love. This is a rough and tough world. And I\u2019m not fighting because of fear \u2014 I\u2019m fighting because we deserve more than this.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Young": [-32.69961999999998, -57.63556999999997]}}, {"headline": "Introducing our star judges for Imagine 2200, Fix\u2019s cli-fi contest", "url": "https://grist.org/fix/introducing-our-star-judges-for-imagine-2200-fixs-cli-fi-contest/", "image_url": "https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Grist-CliFi-0310-leadimage.png", "text": "Introducing our star judges for Imagine 2200, Fix\u2019s cli-fi contest If you haven\u2019t heard, Fix recently launched a cli-fi writing contest. We are over-the-moon excited about it. Fiction writers have a knack for creating compelling, perception-shifting windows into alternate worlds and making complex issues approachable \u2014 and personal. That\u2019s exactly what we hope to do with Imagine 2200: Climate fiction for future ancestors. Anyone (even you!) can submit a short story that envisions our path to a cleaner, greener, and more equitable world. We\u2019ve enlisted a jaw-droppingly impressive panel of judges to read the best of the submissions and choose the 12 we\u2019ll publish in a digital collection this summer. (Did we mention there\u2019s cash involved? The grand-prize winner will pocket $3,000, with $2,000 and $1,000 going to the second- and third-place winners respectively.) Sheree Ren\u00e9e Thomas, Adrienne Maree Brown, Morgan Jerkins, and Kiese Laymon know their way around a narrative. Between them, they\u2019ve written more than a dozen books \u2014 memoirs, novels, and essay and short story collections that explore race, culture, family, nature, and even time travel. And they\u2019ve earned heaps of awards and distinctions for their outstanding work. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy Fix caught up with our illustrious judges to talk about their approaches to climate fiction and other literature, the impact they think it can have, and what they\u2019re hoping to read in Imagine 2200. Their comments have been edited for length and clarity. Sheree Ren\u00e9e Thomas is a fiction writer, poet, and editor in Memphis. Her works include Nine Bar Blues, Sleeping Under the Tree of Life, and Shotgun Lullabies. Thomas was recently named editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. Storytelling is one of the oldest forms of communication. It touches things in us, and it stays in our memories longer, I believe. Art is more vital in these days than ever, as we\u2019re living through a pandemic. Climate change has been something I have explored in my creative work for a while. It has directly impacted my own family here in Memphis. We used to be able to fish in the Mississippi River, and now that\u2019s not advised. I\u2019m in the middle of a fight to keep an oil pipeline from going through a historic community in South Memphis called Boxtown that was created right after emancipation. People are rallying around that. In the short stories for this contest, I trust that writers are going to look around them and pull up the very real things that are happening in our world right now. Ideas are great, but if you don\u2019t tell me in a way that makes me care about and invest in what happens to the characters, then it\u2019s just so-so. I think it\u2019s an amazing time for speculative-fiction writers, and it\u2019s so good to see Afrofuturism embraced by a larger community. I\u2019m here for it. So many wonderful writers are adding their voices to the genre. And lots of other creative projects are coming from it \u2014 films and animation and graphic novels \u2014 and people are using these as case studies for social change in real time. I see it as an open-source code that\u2019s constantly evolving and changing, and that\u2019s the way it should always be. My advice to writers who are considering submitting: Read your work aloud! It\u2019s an incantation. And it puts the story in a different light. You\u2019ll find some of the missing beats, you\u2019ll find areas you have an opportunity to expand upon. Oh, and send it in on time! Adrienne Maree Brown is a scholar and activist in Detroit. She is the author of Emergent Strategy and Pleasure Activism, and co-edited the anthology Octavia\u2019s Brood: Science Fiction from Social Justice Movements. I think it\u2019s difficult in this moment to tell a story about our future that is neither dystopian nor utopian \u2014 that\u2019s not some scenario in which we get everyone into a lush green garden and it\u2019s all good, but it\u2019s also not Mad Max Fury Road. Interdependence is going to have to change our trajectory as a species, and I think fiction has to be the place where we try out what that looks like. I\u2019m very critical of the fiction I write. Every time, I\u2019m like, \u201cI was aiming for Toni Morrison and I landed at The Bachelorette.\u201d But I had good intentions! \u201cThe River\u201d is the story that I think comes the closest to cli-fi for me. It is a story about the Detroit River responding to gentrification and climate injustice and fighting back. For me, when I think of climate fiction, when I think of climate justice, I think about partnering with the land. Partnering with the water. Partnering with the air. Partnering with the forces of change that our planet represents \u2014 not saving it. We are heading toward a future in which Black and brown people are the majority in the U.S. \u2014 and we are heading toward a future in which climate crisis is guaranteed, based on the behavior we\u2019ve already engaged in. So we are called to be prophets in this moment. When we did Octavia\u2019s Brood, most of the contributors were non-fiction thinkers, movement thinkers, scholars, academics. And they wrote some of the most prescient, brilliant fiction. So, my advice to writers: Don\u2019t think that it\u2019s outside of the realm of your possibility. We write because we have a critique of the current circumstances. So if you want to change things, here\u2019s the invitation. Morgan Jerkins is an author and editor in New York City. She wrote This Will Be My Undoing and Wandering in Strange Lands. Her debut novel, Caul Baby, will be released next month. In this contest, I hope to see stories that focus on Black and brown populations. I hope to see stories that highlight all of the -isms and phobias that have debilitated our society and how they will metastasize with climate change. I also hope people will explore how climate affects us not just on the grand scale, but the granular. I grew up in New Jersey. This year, I visited my mother for Christmas, and we followed a tradition that she used to follow with her parents: going around the neighborhoods to see the Christmas lights. She noted that it was different this time because there was no snow. That was the first time I thought that not only is the climate changing, perhaps our traditions are changing, too. And tradition, especially familial tradition, is something I have explored in my writing. I think cli-fi is a flexible term. For me, it means possibility. I think about Octavia Butler\u2019s work \u2014 some of the stuff she\u2019s written, we\u2019re living it now. For those of us who read a lot, we understand the power literature wields. Who\u2019s to say writing isn\u2019t a prophecy? Who\u2019s to say that whatever somebody is writing right now might not be the basis for policy proposals in the future? Ultimately, I hope these stories reveal how our imaginations can help build a better reality. We need to be imaginative about the future and what it could be \u2014 not only to serve as a guiding light, but to serve as a balm for these current, difficult times. Kiese Laymon is a professor of English and creative writing at the University of Mississippi. He is the author of Heavy and How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America. His debut novel, Long Division, will be reissued later this year. My first novel is about Black kids in Mississippi who go into the woods in 2013, 1985, and 1964. (There\u2019s a time-travel element.) One thing I was exploring was environmental degradation. The woods change from green, to brown, to eventually no longer existing. I wanted to subtextually ask the reader, \u201cWhat does it mean when these green spaces that rural Black children play in disappear? And why? Does it have anything to do with how close these communities are to power plants and incinerators?\u201d I didn\u2019t make that explicit, but I was trying to show it in the way the kids kept asking why the forest was changing. I think cli-fi as a genre foregrounds climate\u2019s relationship to people, places, things, and culture. I\u2019m really excited about the elastic way this can be interpreted. In Imagine 2200, I hope people write stories from the points of view of things other than humans. I\u2019m interested in post-human stories \u2014 maybe somebody wants to write a story from the POV of the climate itself, or a pine tree, or a crawdad, or a possum. I hope people are as creative as possible, and that they use this opportunity to write a story they might have needed permission to try. I also hope people who don\u2019t think they mess with sci-fi or cli-fi will be encouraged to apply. Sometimes I\u2019ve had the most success while writing a genre that I didn\u2019t particularly like and wanted to renovate. If you are tired of cli-fi, if you are tired of writing, fam, use this as an opportunity to expand, explore, destroy, and wonderfully, beautifully, tenderly build.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Memphis": [35.14976000000007, -90.04924999999997], "University": [34.36515000000003, -89.53374999999994], "New York": [40.71455000000003, -74.00713999999994], "Detroit": [42.33168000000006, -83.04799999999994]}}, {"headline": "A fireball, a driveway and a priceless meteorite", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-56337876", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F848/production/_117506536_justincase.jpg", "text": "A fireball, a driveway and a priceless meteorite image captionHannah, Rob and Cathryn are celebrating an extraordinary find \"We're still pinching ourselves - to believe that this actually happened on our drive!\" Rob Wilcock, his wife Cathryn and daughter Hannah are astounded to find themselves at the centre of a major scientific discovery. It was their property in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, that was hit by the most valuable space rock ever to fall on the UK. The meteorite has had British scientists in raptures of joy. It's a carbonaceous chondrite - a dark stony material that retains unaltered chemistry from the formation of our Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, and, as such, could give us fresh insights on how the planets came into being. The first thing the Wilcock family knew about it was when they heard a dull thud outside their house on the night of Sunday 28 February. \"When I heard it drop, I stood up and looked out the window to see what was there,\" recalled Hannah. \"But because it was dark I couldn't see anything. \"It was only the next morning when we went out that we saw it on the drive - a bit like a kind of splatter. And in all honesty, my original thought was - has someone been driving around the Cotswolds lobbing lumps of coal into people's gardens?\" she told BBC News. \"Either that or someone had upturned a barbecue tray,\" chimed in Cathryn. Scientists knew fragments of a meteorite must be in the Gloucestershire area. Their cameras had recorded the rock coming through the atmosphere that Sunday night, creating a huge fireball in the process. media caption\"It blows your mind\": The people of Winchcombe react to the meteorite discovery Imagery from multiple angles allowed researchers to narrow the drop zone, and when they went on the media to make an appeal on the Monday, they hoped one or two people might come forward with an interesting find. In fact, they were inundated with pictures. Most had nothing to do with meteorites, but when Open University planetary scientist Richard Greenwood looked at the Wilcocks' picture, he was blown away. \"It was one of those moments when your legs start going wobbly. I saw this thing; it was like a splat across [the Wilcocks'] drive; and it had all these rays coming off it; and I just thought - that is a meteorite. It was instantaneous,\" he said. With all the hullabaloo that was bound to follow the discovery, Rob's initial reaction was to try to stay out of the limelight - to be anonymous. But when he thought it through a little more, Rob said the three of them recognised they should talk about what had happened to them. \"We've been wrestling with the question of whether we should talk about it, and in the end we decided we should. There seems to be such a lot of genuine public interest in the find,\" Rob told BBC News. media captionThousands of people reported seeing the fireball \"We're absolutely thrilled that something that's going to be so valuable to science, to the human understanding of the world and of the Solar System has happened, and that we can be a small part in it.\" The family have donated the meteorite remains to the national collection held by the Natural History Museum in London. They were determined the rock should not go to a dealer, but to science. The last meteorite fall to be picked up in the UK was 30 years ago. That was an \"ordinary chondrite\" - a common type of space rock. The Winchcombe meteorite is far more valuable. Studying its chemistry - and what it can tell us about the conditions that went into building the planets - will keep scientists busy for years. As for the small Gloucestershire market town - it's now firmly on the map. \"We always felt that the Cotswolds is a wonderful place to live.

The Antikythera Mechanism has baffled experts since it was found on a Roman-era shipwreck in Greece in 1901. The hand-powered Ancient Greek device is thought to have been used to predict eclipses and other astronomical events. But only a third of the device survived, leaving researchers pondering how it worked and what it looked like.

But on Monday, Biden\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, released its final environmental impact statement for Vineyard Wind. The project would plant 62 turbines capable of powering 400,000 homes about 15 miles off of Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts. By completing and releasing the Vineyard Wind review so quickly, the administration has effectively greased the path forward for the industry. Vineyard Wind is one of 12 offshore wind projects currently proposed along the East Coast, and the BOEM estimates that around 2,000 turbines could be spinning in the Atlantic Ocean by 2030. A week after stepping into office, Biden committed via executive order to doubling U.S. offshore wind capacity by 2030. By some calculations, Vineyard Wind will single-handedly accomplish that goal once it\u2019s built. There will be a 30-day public comment period before the BOEM reaches a final decision on permitting the Vineyard Wind project, which will also need approvals from the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. If it clears those hurdles, the project could begin construction later this year. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy The industry hailed the Biden administration\u2019s accelerated review process as a sign that, well, the wind is now at its back. Liz Burdock, head of the nonprofit group Business Network for Offshore Wind, told Politico the \u201cannouncement provides the regulatory greenlight the industry needs to attract investments and move projects forward.\u201d The industry also received a boost in December with the extension of an investment tax credit that was passed as part of the omnibus spending bill. While the Biden administration makes friends in the wind industry, it may be stirring up friction with fishermen. Fishing industry groups were unhappy with the Vineyard Wind review, despite both Massachusetts and Rhode Island setting aside millions to compensate them for any losses associated with the project. The next development in the federal queue, the South Fork Wind farm off the coast of Montauk, New York, is currently stalled by negotiations with fishermen, as well as a legal battle with wealthy Long Island residents over the cable that would connect the turbines to the grid. But Wait \u2026 There\u2019s More. After ping-ponging between the House and Senate, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package finally arrived on Joe Biden\u2019s desk, where he signed it on Thursday afternoon. While the bulk of the money in the American Rescue Plan is earmarked for economic recovery and public health, a few climate-friendly measures are included: $30.5 billion to rescue public transit agencies, which have been devastated by the pandemic. Expanding public transit is an essential tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. $4.5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, which helps low-income families pay their energy bills and provides funding for home repairs and improvements that help reduce energy consumption. $350 billion to state and local governments that could go to anything from water infrastructure to climate change resilience to broadband projects, which bridge the digital divide that threatens vulnerable communities when extreme weather strikes. Much more is expected in the way of climate and clean energy policy in an infrastructure package the administration is cooking up.

I started dating a woman who I met on an app during COVID-19. The relationship requires me to drive several hours every other weekend, which is fine for now, but I feel pretty guilty about all that driving from a climate perspective! But the other thing is, we\u2019ve spent such little time together I\u2019m not sure I really like this person or if I just don\u2019t want to be alone. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy A. Dear ROMEO, There are so, so, so many unenviable romantic situations to be in during COVID-19. Just every single one seems difficult! My heart certainly goes out to the cohabiting, the married, the forced-into-a-serious-relationship-by-shutdown-order. But the single-and-seeking in particular? Let me speak from experience when I say: Woof! The very last thing I did before shutdown, a year ago this very week, was an extremely run-of-the-mill tacos-and-margaritas date with someone I\u2019d been seeing in a super casual capacity. He was perfectly nice, but it was clear we had no interest in a serious future together. However, once it sunk in that (1) meeting new people would now constitute both an ethical and medical hazard and (2) I would be very much alone in a studio apartment for the foreseeable future, I started to think: \u201cMaybe this guy is good for me! Perhaps we should weather this storm together and it will bring us closer!\u201d I didn\u2019t end up acting on that particular misguided, warm body-seeking impulse and neither did he. We didn\u2019t see each other again and probably never will. And as much as the pursuant months were very, very lonely and isolated, I didn\u2019t question that decision. Because \u2014 as you reference in your own question \u2014 it doesn\u2019t feel good to tie yourself to something that your heart simply isn\u2019t in! It can even make you feel lonelier. And we can find ourselves searching for concrete, rational excuses to leave these tepid relationships, such as, \u201cthe gas mileage of this relationship is weighing on my climate conscience.\u201d This dilemma has actually come up in this very column before! If you are someone who is generally trying to lead a climate-conscious life \u2014 as you seem to be, given you\u2019re concerned about the gas expenditures of driving to and from your girlfriend\u2019s home \u2014 then you are probably familiar with the sensation of having to choose among several lackluster options. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s no good public transit and/or decent bike infrastructure in your town, so you buy as efficient a hybrid car as you can afford. Problem solved, right? But then you find yourself meticulously weighing the various planetary pros and cons of everything in the grocery aisle. You might even go down the extremely never-ending rabbit hole of what makes a \u201ctruly sustainable\u201d purchase. The more you examine your life, the more you will realize how many compromises \u2014 climate and otherwise \u2014 we have to make if we are to meet our own modern, human needs. Relationships are no exception. I have also experienced the sinking feeling that there are no good matches out there, and the related downer thought that you\u2019ll eventually have to lower your standards or be alone forever. And yet, it\u2019s an undeniable fact that there are far more humans than there are net-zero-carbon items \u2014 even in a Seattle grocery co-op! And in the age of dating apps, that platitudinous sentiment really is truer than ever before. If you were an economics major examining the situation, you\u2019d note you have many thousands of options at your literal fingertips. That incredible variety theoretically should provide a sort of countercurrent to the desire to simply shack up with the next person who checks enough of your boxes. If the goal of dating is to find the most optimized partner possible, why would you call off the hunt when your best option could be just around the corner? The entire premise of economics is that humans make rational decisions, which is why economics is an extremely flawed field. An excellent example of this is the realm of ostensibly environmentally-driven decisions, for which there are all kinds of measurable factors you can weigh against each other. Certain variables can be in conflict with each other and their relative values are difficult to estimate, but you could put together a spreadsheet and more or less figure out how one choice empirically compares to another in terms of carbon emissions or water usage or anything in that realm. Climate scientists do it all the time! That\u2019s how we know things, like that red meat has a higher carbon footprint than chicken, and that cotton is a more water-intensive crop than polyester. And yet, over and over and over again, people will choose with their feelings over facts. You can know that by nearly every climate measure, a cheeseburger is a terrible dietary decision, but you will find a way to rationalize it if your craving for one is strong enough. I get dozens of emails from readers who feel guilty about air travel because they know about its prodigious carbon footprint. Guess what? I guarantee you that no matter what I say, each of those letter-writers will continue to take flights, if it\u2019s to a destination they\u2019ve always dreamed of or to see a person they dearly miss. Regular readers of this column know that I generally take a pretty easygoing stance when it comes to relatively minor climate sins, because the culpability of your average car commuter is negligible compared to fossil fuel companies, denialist politicians, and the big banks that fund them. We will eventually have to abandon some climate-threatening activities like driving gas-powered cars, and I appreciate that you\u2019re already thinking about that, but it doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with your actual dilemma here. You want to know how you feel about your current partner, and carbon footprints have nothing to do with that. I\u2019m not berating you: To be clear, I\u2019ve also been in this position. But since we are so inclined to just follow our heart\u2019s desire when it comes to so many other, far less consequential daily choices than potentially choosing a life partner, for crying out loud, it seems insane that there\u2019s such a block for knowing how you feel about someone. Why is it so hard to simply follow one\u2019s feelings when it comes to romantic decisions, the one arena in which it is most advisable to do so? I think the easiest way to know whether you want someone in your life is to note if you miss them when they\u2019re not. And it seems that you have plenty of opportunity to test this, if your potential person lives a couple of hours away. (I have to say \u2014 if you\u2019re even willing to travel this distance, there has to be something appealing about this person!) Do you want to tell them things throughout the day? When you\u2019re alone and want company, do you think of them specifically or do others come to mind? And when you have plans to see this person, do you feel happy anticipation, lukewarm dread, or nothing at all? My advice to you is to stop trying to measure and weigh and simply feel what you feel. Trust your instincts! And give yourself all the time you need to let those instincts really talk to you! Relatably, Umbra Grist's comments only work with JavaScript.

Dr Ashley King from London's Natural History Museum (NHM) said nothing like it had ever been recorded in the UK before. \"Carbonaceous chondrites are particularly special because they are essentially the left-over building blocks of our Solar System. \"Many contain simple organics and amino acids; some of them contain minerals formed by water - so, all the ingredients are there for understanding how you make a habitable planet such as the Earth,\" he told BBC News. image captionThe thrill of it: It's difficult to overstate the importance of this find Thousands of people reported seeing a blazing light rush across the sky at 21:54 GMT on Sunday 28 February. But, crucially, the event was also captured on the array of special cameras operated by the UK Fireball Alliance (UKFAll). Their information was able to pinpoint the likely area of debris fall. \"Somewhere north of Cheltenham, over towards Stow-On-The-Wold\", was the prediction. This would still have been \"a needle in a haystack\" quest, but researchers were in luck. Some of the meteorite had smashed down on to a Winchcombe resident's front drive. media caption\"When I looked in the plastic bag my legs went wobbly\" Dr Richard Greenwood was despatched to see the Winchcombe resident, who wishes to be anonymous. \"I looked in this plastic bag he'd been told to put it in, and my legs went wobbly. It was unbelievable. This is a very special meteorite,\" the Open University researcher recalled. A search team was immediately sent out to comb the local area for more fragments. And, in the meantime, other property owners started notifying scientists of their discoveries, too. All told, there must be 300-400g of material, most of it now lodged with the NHM. The pieces are small - marble-sized. Prof Monica Grady, also from the OU, describes them as looking like \"a broken barbecue briquette. It is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen\", she told BBC News. image copyrightGlasgow University image captionThe speed of response will have limited contamination of the samples It's hard to overstate just how significant this is for British meteoritic science. Of the approximately 65,000 meteorites in collections worldwide, only 1,206 had eyewitnesses to their fall, and of these only 51 are of the carbonaceous chondrite type. Because this fireball was tracked via camera on entry to Earth's atmosphere, its orbit has been worked out. The object came from the outer asteroid belt, out towards Jupiter. image copyrightNatasha Stephen (@EMC_PlymUni) image captionA huge research effort will now be focused on the Winchcombe haul This means its composition almost certainly will be very primitive. \"Basically, that's part of the Solar System we regard as like a deep freeze of material that's 4.5 billion years old,\" explained the NHM's Prof Sara Russell. \"It hasn't had a chance to change at all from pre-planetary time. It will give us an insight into what our Solar System was like before the planets were there.\" media captionThousands of people reported seeing the fireball The American and Japanese space agencies have despatched probes to bring back similar material from the asteroids themselves. But the Winchcombe meteorite would make almost as good a subject for study, said Dr Greenwood. \"Yes, it will have been affected by passage through the atmosphere, but it must be very close to pristine. The chap in Winchcombe who collected it did so within 12 hours of falling. It's as good as you will ever get collected here on Earth.\" The last space rock fall recovered in the UK was in 1991 - the so called Glatton Meteorite, because it fell in the village of Glatton near Peterborough. Mr Arthur Pettifor was tending his onions in his garden when a 10cm rock dropped into his hedge. It's quite possible more fragments of the Winchcombe meteorite still await discovery. image copyrightOpen University image captionRichard Greenwood with another fragment picked up in nearby Woodmancote Scientists urge people in the local area to remain vigilant. They should be looking for small blackish stones, or even a mound of dark dust. Anyone who finds what they think might be a meteorite is asked to photograph it in situ, noting the GPS co-ordinates from a phone, if that's possible. The object should then be placed in foil without direct handling. And the absolute no-no: do not put a magnet near the material. This could destroy important information needed to study the rock. The Winchcombe investigation has also included scientists from the universities of Glasgow, Manchester, Plymouth, and Imperial College London. image copyrightGlasgow University image captionScience bounty: Nothing like it has ever been recorded in the UK before", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Jupiter": [26.93276000000003, -80.10188999999997], "Glasgow": [55.857830000000035, -4.242509999999925], "Manchester": [53.47959000000003, -2.248739999999941], "Peterborough": [52.57346000000007, -0.24809999999996535], "Greenwood": [39.61369000000008, -86.11012999999997], "Of": [40.94371000000007, 40.26192000000003], "London": [51.50642000000005, -0.1272099999999341], "Plymouth": [50.37617000000006, -4.136629999999968], "Cheltenham": [51.89804000000004, -2.0784399999999437]}}, {"headline": "How did we get here?

Like many Sicilians from Catania, the 18-year-old has learnt quickly how to make her way home on a road covered in volcanic dust during one of the volcano's 11 eruptions in the past three weeks. A 12th eruption was under way on Friday. Every so often, the volcano's four main craters awake with intense, simultaneous blasts. These episodes create a spectacular natural firework display, replete with bubbles, fountains and flows of lava. Within minutes, neighbouring towns and villages are showered with flakes of ash and other debris. 'Lava falling on my roof' Irene's trip with her mother through the deserted streets of her home town of Nicolosi, on Etna's slopes, turned into a nightmare when her Peugeot 107 car was stopped by a sound she had never heard before. \"It was like a sudden crackling; like hail pouring down and popping around. I thought it was because of the ash on the street,\" she said. \"Instead, it was fragments of lava (lapilli) falling on both my roof and my windscreen from a giant red cloud right over me.\" It was 16 February and the sky was already inflamed by the sunset. It was to be the first in an array of violent episodes on Etna, increasing in power each time. Those paroxysms have since come in the middle of the night, at sunrise, during a storm and even under the light of a full moon. Irene Corsaro could feel the stones grinding under the car's tyres and she soon realised how lucky she was to be wearing her anti-Covid facemask. \"The red-coloured air was very poor, heavy to breathe in.\" They rushed home to pack in case they needed to evacuate. image copyrightIrene Corsaro image captionIrene Corsaro shows some of the fragments of lava that showered her car Clouds of sulphur dioxide (SO2), visible from space, have reached as far away as China. But the ash and the heavier lapilli stay local. They drape the sides of the volcano and blanket at least 16 towns around Etna's cone. Fornazzo, Giarre and Zafferana are among those affected, and even coastal towns like Riposto and Torre Archirafi. Etna has released some 40 million cubic metres of volcanic material, says volcanologist Boris Behncke, who monitors Etna closely for the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV). \"It is quite a lot,\" he tells the BBC. In comparison, the Etna eruption that threatened the town of Randazzo in 1981 released a mere 20 million cubic metres of material. Watching Etna's destructive power From my window, 20km (12 miles) south-east of Etna's summit, I have an unbroken view of the volcano. There is something primordial about being indoors as nature unleashes its energy. It starts with a column of dust that can climb as high as 12km, then lava fountains, pyroclastic flow and even lightning - mainly from the south-east crater, but from the other three as well. image copyrightFrancesca Marchese The eruptions may be spectacular, but they are a nuisance too. Lava dust falls over my head and over my washing line. I have spent much of the past three weeks of curfew sweeping the floor. My car windscreen is constantly covered by a dark patina of grime, but you must not use water to clear it. This glaze contains sharp glass particles that will scrape it beyond repair. No wonder some people have wrapped up their parked cars in bed-sheets to protect them. image copyrightReuters image captionPeople have been using sheets to cover and protect their car windscreens When it rains, the drizzle turns carpets of lava dust into something resembling concrete. It blocks gutters and drainage channels, prompting flooding and water seeping into houses. Etna's explosions generate \"infrasonic waves\" that the human ear does not pick up because of their low sound frequency, but the glass in the windows does. After so many eruptions, you can now tell what Etna is doing simply by listening to the trembling of the windows. It wakes you up with a jolt in the middle of the night. The sound of a column of ash and dust is different, more of a jingle-jangle. Twelve tonnes of dust The damage to the area has been immense and the Sicilian region has declared a crisis for 13 towns on Etna and another 30 surrounding the volcano. Orange groves and other crops have been destroyed and on one occasion the motorway between Fiumefreddo and Giarre was shut to allow dust to be cleared. Motorbikes are banned and the speed limit has been cut to 20km/h. image copyrightReuters image captionThis message scrawled in the ash in the centre of Giarre reads: \"Etna volcano, what a nice gift\" Schools in Giarre were shut for three days and the weekly market suspended. Locals have been instructed to collect the dust in transparent bags and not to mix it with ordinary rubbish. \"We have to deal with six kilos of volcanic dust in every square metre, with a total of 12 tonnes,\" Giarre Mayor Angelo D'Anna told the BBC. \"The latest black rain lasted just 30 minutes and generated as much rubbish as we usually have in a year. It'll cost up to \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3510,000) and we are worried because it is going to happen again and again. How can we pay for it?\" The regional government is to provide \u20ac1m and will ask the Rome government for more help, but there is no regional plan to manage the dust. It may be a natural phenomenon, but it is treated as waste and there is not yet anything planned to remove it. image copyrightGetty Images image captionSacks of ash are stacked up beside the road in the town of Zafferana Etnea Sweeping balconies of black dust has become a regular event for the thousands who live in the towns around Etna. Every roof, terrace, porch, veranda and geranium-adorned balustrade has turned black. Even gardens are barely green any more. How unusual are the eruptions? Etna is no stranger to these episodes. Despite the extraordinary amount of volcanic material that has erupted, experts agree the volcano is merely repeating previous patterns of behaviour. But they also admit that the power released is greater than before. \"In the past we witnessed two or three strong events, and others that were weaker,\" says volcanologist Boris Behncke. \"Now every paroxysm is strong. Nonetheless, at the moment Etna is deflating, there is no more magma coming and its system is stable.\" media captionLiving in the shadow of Mount Etna I have sensed a change too. I have always seen an eruption with a flame that goes on and off like a lighter. This time I have seen at least three tongues of flame with lava fountains on both sides of Etna, and a constant wall of flame. As long as the activity remains on the summit there is no danger.

But a new pipeline that could soon wind through Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas promises to do the opposite. Summit Carbon Solutions, a spinoff of an Iowa-based agricultural company, recently announced it is developing a $2 billion pipeline project that will carry carbon dioxide captured from ethanol refineries scattered across the Midwest to a site in North Dakota where it will be pumped thousands of feet underground. The CO2 will start in the atmosphere, where it is heating up the planet, and get sucked down to earth by stalks of corn. While some of it will be turned into ethanol and blended into gasoline, the rest will be returned to the earth\u2019s crust and \u2014 if all goes according to plan \u2014 buried forever. If it gets built, the project will prove a new business model for carbon capture in the biofuels industry and expand the country\u2019s network of carbon dioxide pipelines, infrastructure that some researchers and climate advocates say is necessary to bring U.S. emissions down to zero. Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy Summit told Grist it already has agreements with enough biorefineries \u2014 a general term for facilities that create fuel out of organic material \u2014 to sequester 5 million tons of CO2 per year once all of the components of the project are up and running, which it expects to be in 2024. Its goal is to sign on additional partners, including other types of carbon-emitting facilities like fertilizer producers and power plants, to capture and store at least 10 million tons of CO2, which is about the amount that the state of Vermont emits in a year. \u201cWith the inbound interest we\u2019ve received from biorefineries and other industrial CO2 emitters since our project announcement, it\u2019s likely that we may even exceed\u201d 10 million tons a year, said Bruce Rastetter, CEO of Summit Agricultural Group, in an email. Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, is often criticized for being too expensive to be worthwhile, but the process looks fairly different depending on where the carbon is being captured. Fossil fuel\u2013fired power plants emit a hodgepodge of gases, making it difficult and energy-intensive to build a capture system that can separate out the CO2. But at a biorefinery where corn or another form of biomass is fermented into ethanol, the process emits a pure stream of CO2, with just a little water vapor mixed in. \u201cThere\u2019s no energy required for capture\u201d at biorefineries, said Daniel Sanchez, an engineer and energy systems analyst at the University of California, Berkeley, explaining that only a small amount was needed to compress and dehydrate the gas. That\u2019s \u201cthe reason why this works so well, why it\u2019s cheap, and why everyone wants to do it,\u201d he said. Still, very few do. Two biofuel plants in Kansas capture their CO2 and sell it to oil companies that pipe it out to aging oil fields and pump it underground to coax up additional oil \u2014 a process known as \u201cenhanced oil recovery.\u201d Only one biorefinery buries its CO2 underground solely for the sake of taking it out of the atmosphere, and the project was enabled by substantial financial support from the Department of Energy. That plant, located in Decatur, Illinois, and owned by Archer Daniels Midland, has the capacity to capture 1 million tons of CO2 per year and bury it nearby. (As of 2019 the project was only capturing and storing about half that amount, which the company said was due to reduced ethanol production.) Though it isn\u2019t hard to capture at a biorefinery, until recently, captured CO2 had little worth. But now the economic landscape is changing. Summit\u2019s project was made possible by a confluence of factors. First, in 2018, Congress increased the value of the 45Q tax credit, which will eventually pay up to $50 for every ton of carbon a facility captures and stores underground, and also made it easier to use. The final rules for the enhanced credit were released in January. A second development came in 2019 when California\u2019s Air Resources Board adopted a new carbon capture and storage protocol for its low-carbon fuel standard. That means ethanol facilities that use CCS to lower the carbon intensity of their fuel can generate tradable credits when they sell it in California. Producers of dirtier fuels that don\u2019t meet California\u2019s standards have to buy those credits to comply. Recently, the credits have been selling for around $200 per ton of carbon. Summit told Grist it will earn revenue through the 45Q tax credit in addition to sharing the value of the California fuel standard credits with its partner biorefineries. The company also expects similar low-carbon fuel markets to develop in other parts of North America and around the world, potentially creating more demand for Summit\u2019s partner refineries. The third factor is that North Dakota is one of two states that the Environmental Protection Agency recently granted authority over regulating Class VI Underground Injection wells \u2014 the category of wells developed specifically for geologic sequestration of CO2 \u2014 making the permitting process much easier for companies that want to inject carbon underground. Unlike Iowa, Minnesota, or South Dakota, most of North Dakota sits atop the right geological conditions for CO2 storage, called deep saline formations. Summit\u2019s project is designed to connect biorefineries dotting the midwest to saline formations in North Dakota.Dane McFarlane and Elizabeth Abramson / / Great Plains Institute Brad Crabtree of the Great Plains Institute, an energy nonprofit that advocates for policies that support scaling up carbon capture and storage, said that the project not only benefits the climate but also creates a significant economic opportunity in the region. \u201cI think it\u2019s groundbreaking in terms of its potential to transform perspectives and attitudes about what is possible in terms of addressing climate change and managing CO2,\u201d he said. Growing crops for fuel has always been controversial, as it risks taking land away from food production, and cropland is sometimes created by razing forests and other important habitats. Growing corn, in particular, requires a lot of fertilizer, which can run off into nearby waters and create harmful algal blooms. But if you assess corn ethanol solely on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions, past studies have found that the average CO2 emissions from the full life cycle of producing and burning ethanol are about 20 percent lower than gasoline. A more recent study conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture asserts that ethanol production has become more efficient and currently emits, on average, 40 percent less CO2 than gasoline. (Ethanol doesn\u2019t fully replace gasoline \u2014 it is typically blended into gas at about 10 percent.) Jeremy Martin, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that even as the world moves quickly to switch to electric vehicles, a full phase-out of gas-powered cars is going to take decades. It will take even longer to find zero-emissions solutions for airplanes and cargo ships, which are expected to increasingly adopt lower-carbon fuels made from biomass or hydrogen, in the meantime. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to use quite a bit of ethanol for quite a few years to come,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to both do what we can to decarbonize all the fuels we\u2019re using and we need to move to the cleanest fuels that we can at the same time.\u201d Sanchez said that adding CCS to the fermentation process, as Summit is doing, will probably reduce the carbon intensity of the ethanol by 30 to 40 percent. But there are other ways it can become cleaner still. Most biorefineries burn fossil fuels to create heat for the fermentation process, and capturing the emissions from that step or burning biomass instead of fossil fuels \u2014 or, better yet, both \u2014 would lower ethanol\u2019s carbon intensity further. Fertilizer plants produce a lot of emissions, and installing CCS technology there would also improve the life-cycle emissions for ethanol \u2014 since, remember, growing corn for ethanol requires fertilizer. In the long term, replacing corn with other crops that don\u2019t require as many resources to grow, like switchgrass, would also substantially improve ethanol\u2019s carbon footprint. Sanchez is optimistic that mechanisms like California\u2019s low-carbon fuel standard will continue to push the industry toward these cleaner options. Beyond lowering the emissions associated with ethanol, Summit\u2019s pipeline project is a step toward building the infrastructure that some researchers and climate advocates say is necessary to bring U.S. emissions down to zero. In a report released last year that looked at how the U.S. could achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Princeton researchers found that success depends on a new national network of CO2 pipelines \u2014 potentially 70,000 miles worth. They found that even if the U.S. electrifies vehicles and buildings, and replaces almost all fossil fuel electricity with renewables, we\u2019ll likely need to capture CO2 from cement production (which can\u2019t yet be electrified), from gas-fired power plants (if any remain), from biofuels and hydrogen production, and maybe even from machines that can suck carbon directly out of the air \u2014 and transport it to a place where it can be used or sequestered underground. The new secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, seems to agree. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s still nascent technology in capturing CO2 emissions, but we\u2019ve got to do it on all types of fuel, if we\u2019re going to get to net-zero,\u201d she said in a recent interview with E&E News. \u201cThe CO2 pipelines that will be necessary for it could put lots of people to work, so I think it\u2019s a big job opportunity, I think it\u2019s a big carbon reduction opportunity, and we\u2019re going to be bullish about it.\u201d Some climate advocates reject carbon capture on the basis that it extends a lifeline to carbon-intensive industries and technologies that should be phased out as quickly as possible. And carbon capture does not solve the air and water pollution issues associated with any of the industrial processes it has been proposed for. But when it comes to finding solutions for carbon emissions, Crabtree said that it\u2019s irresponsible to take options off the table. He stressed that we are trying to decarbonize in a political context, where we need many stakeholders, including companies and workers, to support climate policy. He said carbon capture allows existing facilities that pay high-wage jobs to manage their emissions. \u201cWe have to be putting options on the table or we will not get to zero anywhere near in time,\u201d he said.", "sentiment": ":)", "keywords": ["keyword-1", "keyword-2", "keyword-3"], "locations": {"Union": [40.69635000000005, -74.26956999999999], "Kansas": [38.48472671300004, -98.38017062899996], "Midland": [32.00002000000006, -102.07445999999999], "Summit": [40.741490000000056, -74.35958999999997], "Most": [50.51479000000006, 13.637870000000078], "Iowa": [42.07469810400005, -93.49997241099999], "Berkeley": [37.86988000000008, -122.27053999999998], "Decatur": [39.84585000000004, -88.95208999999994], "University": [34.36515000000003, -89.53374999999994], "Princeton": [40.35101000000003, -74.65473999999995]}}, {"headline": "Nasa's 'megarocket' passes assembly milestone", "url": "https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-56339708", "image_url": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12FDE/production/_117509777_ksc-20210303-ph-ilw01_0008.jpg", "text": "Each identical booster is divided into five segments bookended by large rocket pieces known as the forward and aft assemblies. image copyrightNASA image captionArtwork: How the SLS will look during its ascent The SRBs have been stacked on a structure called the mobile launcher, which will support the testing, checkout and servicing of the SLS, as well as transfer it to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. The boosters, which are similar to the ones that helped launch the now-retired space shuttle, will provide 75% of total thrust at lift-off. On Twitter, Charles Precourt, vice president for propulsion systems at Northrop Grumman - which manufactures the SRBs - said it was \"exciting to see fully stacked boosters\". Engineers with Nasa's Exploration Ground Systems team positioned the first segment on 21 November 2020, and continued the process until the final nose assembly was added on 2 March this year. \"Stacking the solid rocket boosters is a huge milestone,\" said senior vehicle operations manager Cliff Lanham. \"It means the rocket is being assembled on the mobile launcher and we are in the final stages of a long journey - getting to launch Artemis 1.\" The SLS has the necessary thrust to propel Nasa's next-generation crew vehicle, Orion, to the Moon without it first having to dock with a separate propulsion stage in Earth orbit. America is returning to the Moon under the Artemis programme (named after Apollo's sister in Greek mythology). The project was initiated under Donald Trump's presidency; but in February, the Biden administration backed the Moon shot. media captionThe four main engines were fired in unison for the first time, but had to be shut down early The Trump White House had set an aggressive target date of 2024 for the US space agency to perform the the first human landing on the Moon since 1972. However, the Biden administration has made no mention of this timeline, leading to speculation that the date will slip. The final large piece of the SLS waiting to be slotted in on the mobile launcher is the orange-coloured core stage, which is currently undergoing evaluation at Nasa's Stennis Space Center near Bay St Louis, Mississippi. Nasa plans to carry out a \"hotfire\" test of the core in mid-March, which will involve igniting all four engines. Engineers are aiming to fire them for the full eight minutes that it takes for the SLS to reach space. The maiden flight of the SLS is currently scheduled for late 2021.
